# Debugging & Help

## Debugging Steps

1. **Read the error message** - Actually read it, don't skim
2. **Check the types** - TypeScript is usually right
3. **Add logging** - `console.log` is your friend
4. **Write a test** - Reproduce the issue in isolation
5. **Simplify** - Remove complexity until it works
6. **Ask for help** - But show what you've tried first
