# Project Overview

Portfolio site for David Josef Mendez - Staff/Senior Software Engineer with SRE experience.

## Critical Requirement

**Only `me@davidmendez.dev` can access admin features. Period. No exceptions, no edge cases, no "maybe later" users.**

This is a hard requirement that must be enforced at every level:
- Server-side validation only
- No client-side checks as security measures
- Email must be EXACTLY `me@davidmendez.dev` (case-sensitive, exact match)
