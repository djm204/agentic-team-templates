# Pull Request Standards

High standards for PR quality, review process, and semantic versioning adherence.

## PR Quality Standards

### Mandatory Pre-Submission Checklist

Before creating a PR, **all** of the following must be true:

- [ ] **Tests**: All tests pass locally
- [ ] **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors
- [ ] **Linting**: No linting errors
- [ ] **Formatting**: Code is formatted
- [ ] **Coverage**: Test coverage maintained or improved (minimum 80%)
- [ ] **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Breaking changes clearly documented
- [ ] **Self-Review**: Code reviewed by author before submission

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
Clear, concise one-sentence description.

## Type
- [ ] Feature (non-breaking)
- [ ] Bug Fix (non-breaking)
- [ ] Breaking Change
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Refactor (non-breaking)

## Changes
- Specific bullet points of what changed

## Testing
- How was this tested?
- What test cases were added/updated?

## Semver Impact
- [ ] **PATCH** (0.0.1): Bug fix, non-breaking
- [ ] **MINOR** (0.1.0): New feature, non-breaking
- [ ] **MAJOR** (1.0.0): Breaking change

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI passes
```

## Code Review Standards

### Reviewer Responsibilities

1. **Security First**: Verify inputs validated, auth checks present
2. **Test Quality**: Ensure tests actually test behavior
3. **Type Safety**: No `any` types, proper TypeScript usage
4. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels
5. **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or expensive operations
6. **DRY**: No repeated code that should be abstracted
7. **Semver**: Verify version bump matches change type

### Review Response Time

- **Urgent (security, critical bugs)**: Within 4 hours
- **Normal (features, fixes)**: Within 24 hours
- **Non-urgent (docs, refactors)**: Within 48 hours

## PR Size Guidelines

- **Small** (< 200 lines): Ideal, easy to review
- **Medium** (200-500 lines): Acceptable
- **Large** (500-1000 lines): Should be split if possible
- **Very Large** (> 1000 lines): **Must be split**

## PR Rejection Criteria

A PR will be rejected if:

- Fails CI checks
- Introduces security vulnerabilities
- Breaks existing functionality without migration path
- Lacks tests for new functionality
- Contains `console.log`, `debugger`, or commented code
- Uses `any` type without justification
- Incorrect semver version bump
- Missing documentation for public APIs
