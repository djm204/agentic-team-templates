# Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

- [ ] Code written and reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliant
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier passing
- [ ] Accessibility tested (keyboard + screen reader)
- [ ] Security reviewed (input validation, auth checks)
- [ ] Performance benchmarked (no regressions)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Committed with conventional commit message
- [ ] PR approved and merged
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Verified working in production

## Brutal Honesty Checklist

Before saying you're done:

- [ ] Did you actually run the tests?
- [ ] Did they actually pass?
- [ ] Did you test the happy path AND error cases?
- [ ] Did you check for XSS vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Did you verify auth checks are server-side?
- [ ] Would you ship this code to production?
- [ ] Would you be proud to show this in a code review?

## Remember

- **Security is not optional** - It's the foundation
- **Tests are not optional** - They're the safety net
- **Types are not optional** - They're the guardrails
- **Accessibility is not optional** - It's basic human decency
- **Clean code is not optional** - It's professional respect

Build it right, or don't build it at all.
