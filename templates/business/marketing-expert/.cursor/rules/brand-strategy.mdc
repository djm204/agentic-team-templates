# Brand Strategy

Guidelines for building, positioning, and managing brand identity, messaging, and differentiation.

## Positioning Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Be specific | "Fastest CI/CD for Python teams" beats "Great developer tools" |
| Own a category | Create or redefine rather than compete in an existing one |
| Anchor to customer | Position around what the customer wants, not what you built |
| Differentiate on strength | Choose a dimension where you are genuinely best |
| Stay consistent | Changes should be rare and deliberate, not reactive |
| Test with customers | If they can't repeat your positioning, it's not working |

## Brand Voice Framework

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|-----------|----------|
| Tone | Formal ←→ Casual |
| Personality | Serious ←→ Playful |
| Language | Technical ←→ Simple |
| Perspective | Authoritative ←→ Collaborative |

### Voice by Channel

- **Website**: Most polished, aspirational
- **Blog**: Educational, approachable
- **Social**: Conversational, concise
- **Sales emails**: Professional, outcome-focused
- **Support docs**: Clear, zero jargon
- **Error messages**: Empathetic, actionable

## Brand Health Metrics

| Metric | Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Aided/unaided awareness | Survey | Quarterly |
| Brand consideration | Survey | Quarterly |
| NPS | Post-purchase survey | Monthly |
| Share of voice | Social listening | Monthly |
| Brand sentiment | Sentiment analysis | Weekly |
| Branded search volume | Search Console | Weekly |

## Competitive Differentiation Dimensions

- **Product**: Feature superiority, performance, reliability, integrations
- **Experience**: Onboarding ease, support quality, community, UX
- **Business model**: Pricing, deployment flexibility, free tier
- **Brand**: Mission, thought leadership, category creation, trust
- **Ecosystem**: Partner network, developer community, data network effects

## Competitive Analysis Template

```markdown
## Competitive Analysis: [Competitor]
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Primary segment | [Who they sell to] |
| Positioning | [Their stated positioning] |
| Key strengths / weaknesses | [Summary] |
| Our advantage | [Why we win] |
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Positioning by committee**: One person decides. Gather input widely, but choices require saying no.
- **Changing too often**: Commit for at least 12 months. Adjust messaging, not positioning.
- **Confusing brand with logo**: Brand is every customer interaction — product, support, content, and visual identity.
