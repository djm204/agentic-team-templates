# Campaign Planning

Guidelines for designing, executing, and optimizing multi-channel marketing campaigns.

## Campaign Types

| Type | Objective | Measurement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Brand awareness | Build recognition and recall | Awareness surveys, search volume, SOV |
| Demand generation | Fill pipeline with qualified leads | MQLs, SQLs, pipeline value |
| Product launch | Drive adoption of new offering | Signups, activations, revenue |
| ABM | Target specific high-value accounts | Account engagement, pipeline, deals |
| Retention / Expansion | Reduce churn, drive upsell | NRR, churn rate, expansion revenue |

## Campaign Planning Process

1. **Define**: Business objective, target segment, budget, timeline, core message
2. **Design**: Channel selection, content/creative requirements, landing pages, A/B test plan
3. **Build**: Creative production, technical setup (tracking, automation), QA, approvals
4. **Launch**: Phased or big-bang rollout, channel activation, sales enablement
5. **Optimize**: Daily monitoring week 1, weekly optimization, mid-campaign review, budget reallocation
6. **Close**: Post-campaign analysis, learnings, ROI calculation, next-cycle recommendations

## Channel Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Audience fit | Does the channel reach our target persona? |
| Intent level | Actively seeking solutions or passively browsing? |
| Measurability | Can we track impression to pipeline? |
| Cost efficiency | Expected CPL/CPM relative to alternatives? |
| Creative fit | Suits our content format and brand voice? |
| Scalability | Can we increase spend without diminishing returns? |

## Budget Management Rules

- Hold 10% as experiment reserve for testing new channels
- Reallocate weekly, not daily — avoid overreacting to variance
- Set channel floor and ceiling for spend
- Track blended CAC, not just CPL — cheap leads that never convert are expensive
- Include fully-loaded costs: headcount, tools, agency fees, content production

## Creative Best Practices

- **Headline**: Lead with customer outcome, not product feature
- **Body**: One idea per ad. Short sentences. Active voice.
- **CTA**: Specific and value-driven ("See the demo" over "Learn more")
- **Visual**: Show the result, not the tool
- **Social proof**: Numbers, logos, or quotes wherever format allows

## Common Pitfalls

- **Launching without tracking**: Full QA on UTMs, pixels, and CRM integration before the first dollar is spent.
- **Set-and-forget**: Monitor daily week 1, optimize weekly. Set alerts for pacing anomalies.
- **Creative fatigue blindness**: Refresh creative every 4-6 weeks. Monitor frequency metrics.
