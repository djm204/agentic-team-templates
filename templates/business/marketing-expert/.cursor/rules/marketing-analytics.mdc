# Marketing Analytics

Guidelines for measurement, attribution, experimentation, and data-driven marketing decisions.

## Key Metrics by Function

| Function | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Demand Gen | Pipeline generated, MQLs, SQLs | CPL, conversion rates, velocity |
| Content | Organic traffic, engaged sessions | Rankings, backlinks, content-to-lead |
| Paid Media | ROAS, CPA, pipeline from paid | CTR, quality score, impression share |
| Email | Revenue per email, conversion rate | Open rate, click rate, unsubscribe |
| Brand | Aided awareness, NPS, SOV | Branded search volume, sentiment |
| Growth | Activation rate, retention, LTV | K-factor, time to value, expansion |

## Attribution Model Selection

| Scenario | Recommended Model |
|----------|------------------|
| Short sales cycle (< 7 days) | Last touch or first touch |
| Medium cycle (1-3 months) | U-shaped or linear |
| Long cycle (3+ months, enterprise) | W-shaped or data-driven |
| Brand-heavy strategy | First touch weighted |
| Multi-channel, high volume | Data-driven / algorithmic |

## Attribution Implementation Essentials

- UTM parameter standards across all channels
- CRM source/campaign fields mapping leads to campaigns
- Touchpoint tracking for every meaningful interaction
- Data warehouse joins unifying ad platform, CRM, and product data

## Funnel Definitions

| Stage | Definition | Owner |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Visitor | Arrives at owned property | Marketing |
| Lead | Provides contact info | Marketing |
| MQL | Meets scoring threshold | Marketing |
| SQL | Sales confirms qualified | Sales |
| Opportunity | Active deal with timeline | Sales |
| Closed Won | Signed contract | Sales |

## Experimentation Standards

- Calculate minimum detectable effect before starting
- Run for at least 2 full business cycles (2-4 weeks)
- Significance threshold: p < 0.05
- Change only one variable per test
- Document hypothesis, setup, results, and learnings
- No peeking — commit to the duration

## Reporting Cadence

| Report | Audience | Frequency | Focus |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Executive summary | C-suite | Monthly | Revenue attribution, CAC, pipeline |
| Demand gen review | Marketing leads | Weekly | Pipeline by channel, spend pacing |
| Campaign performance | Managers | Daily/Weekly | Impressions, clicks, conversions |
| Experiment results | Growth team | Per experiment | Win/loss, learnings, next tests |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Measuring what's easy, not what matters**: Invest in tracking from first touch to closed deal. Revenue attribution beats click counts.
- **Optimizing local maxima**: Test big things first (messaging, offer, audience), then small things (layout, colors).
- **Dashboard overload**: One dashboard per audience. 5-8 metrics max. If a metric doesn't drive a decision, remove it.
