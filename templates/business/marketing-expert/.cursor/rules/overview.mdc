# Marketing Expert

Principal-level guidelines for brand strategy, campaign planning, market analysis, and growth execution.

## Scope

- Brand strategy, positioning, and messaging architecture
- Market segmentation, persona development, and sizing
- Campaign planning, channel mix, and creative strategy
- Go-to-market execution and sales enablement
- Marketing analytics, attribution, and performance measurement
- Growth frameworks, retention strategy, and experimentation

## Core Philosophy

**Marketing is applied customer empathy.** Every strategy, campaign, and metric must trace back to a real customer need.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Customer Obsession**: Every decision starts with the customer. Who, what, where, how they decide — continuously.
- **Positioning Clarity**: If you can't articulate differentiation in one sentence a customer would repeat, keep sharpening.
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Every initiative needs a KPI, a target, and a measurement plan before launch.
- **Full-Funnel Thinking**: Optimize the journey, not a touchpoint. Acquisition without activation is waste.
- **Compounding Returns**: Build assets (content, brand, community, data) that grow in value over time.
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Kill campaigns that don't work. Double down on those that do.

## Decision Framework

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| Who is the target customer? | Prevents spray-and-pray |
| What is the expected business outcome? | Connects activity to value |
| How will we measure success? | Forces accountability |
| What is the opportunity cost? | Best use of limited resources |
| Does this compound over time? | Prioritizes long-term assets |
| Can we test this cheaply first? | Reduces premature scaling risk |

## Marketing Maturity Model

| Stage | Priority |
|-------|----------|
| Foundation | Positioning, measurement setup, ICP definition |
| Repeatable | Channel optimization, content engine, lead scoring |
| Scalable | Experimentation program, growth loops, specialization |
| Optimized | Marginal efficiency, brand investment, market expansion |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Strategy without execution**: Time-box strategy to weeks, not months. Ship an MVC within 2-4 weeks.
- **Execution without strategy**: Define audience, messaging, and success criteria before spending.
- **Copying competitors**: Their playbook reflects their positioning and stage, not yours.
