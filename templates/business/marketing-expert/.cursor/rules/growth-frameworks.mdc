# Growth Frameworks

Guidelines for designing growth loops, running experiments, optimizing retention, and scaling growth.

## Growth Model Selection

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Sales-Led (SLG) | Enterprise, high ACV, complex products |
| Marketing-Led (MLG) | Mid-market, moderate ACV, education-heavy |
| Product-Led (PLG) | Low ACV, self-serve, high volume |
| Community-Led (CLG) | Developer tools, platforms, niche markets |
| Partner-Led | Geographic expansion, regulated industries |

## Growth Loop Anatomy

Every loop has four parts:
- **Input**: What triggers the loop (signup, content creation, purchase)
- **Action**: What the user does (share, invite, create, integrate)
- **Output**: What the action creates (new users, content, data improvement)
- **Amplifier**: What accelerates it (incentives, network effects, algorithmic distribution)

## AARRR Optimization Levers

| Stage | Key Tactics | Primary Metric |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Acquisition | SEO, paid, viral, community, partnerships | CAC, traffic sources |
| Activation | Reduce steps to first value, quick wins, personalization | Time to value, onboarding completion |
| Retention | Habit loops, feature discovery, workflow integration | DAU/MAU, churn rate |
| Revenue | Pricing experiments, upsell, PQL scoring | Conversion to paid, ARPU |
| Referral | Referral programs, sharing features, advocacy | K-factor, NPS |

## Experimentation Program

- **Idea backlog**: Central repository from all teams
- **Prioritization**: ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease) weekly
- **Velocity target**: 2-3 experiments per sprint minimum
- **Documentation**: Every experiment logged with hypothesis, results, learnings
- **Review**: Weekly cross-functional experiment review

### ICE Scoring Guide

| Score | Impact | Confidence | Ease |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| 10 | Massive (>25%) | Proven in similar context | Ship today |
| 7-9 | Large (10-25%) | Strong evidence | 1-2 days |
| 4-6 | Moderate (5-10%) | Reasonable hypothesis | 1-2 weeks |
| 1-3 | Small (<5%) | Pure guess | Major effort |

## Scaling Checklist

| Milestone | Next Action |
|-----------|-------------|
| Channel shows positive ROI at <$5K/month | Increase budget 2-3x |
| ROI holds at 2-3x budget | Continue scaling, test creative variants |
| Diminishing returns at higher spend | Cap spend, find next channel |
| One complete loop cycle observed | Reduce friction, measure cycle time |
| Loop output exceeds input consistently | Invest in amplifiers, remove bottlenecks |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Premature optimization**: Validate the full loop first. Ensure the right people arrive and convert before optimizing any single step.
- **Growth hacking without strategy**: Design a sustainable loop first, then experiment to optimize each step.
- **Ignoring retention**: Measure net growth (new minus churned). Fix retention before pouring more into acquisition.
