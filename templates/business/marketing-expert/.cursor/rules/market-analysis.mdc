# Market Analysis

Guidelines for market research, segmentation, competitive analysis, and sizing.

## Research Methodology

- **Secondary (desk)**: Industry reports, public filings, news, government data, whitepapers
- **Primary (field)**: Customer interviews, surveys, focus groups, win/loss analysis
- **Competitive intel**: Product teardowns, pricing analysis, positioning audit, hiring patterns
- **Synthesis**: Pattern identification, segment definition, opportunity sizing, recommendations

## Segmentation Framework

| Step | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| Define variables | Choose dimensions (firmographic, behavioral, needs-based) | Variable list |
| Collect data | Gather data across variables | Customer dataset |
| Cluster analysis | Group similar profiles | Segment definitions |
| Profile segments | Describe characteristics, size, needs | Segment profiles |
| Evaluate segments | Score: size, growth, accessibility, fit | Prioritized list |
| Select targets | Choose segments based on strategy | Target decisions |

## Segment Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market size | 20% |
| Growth rate | 15% |
| Competitive intensity | 15% |
| Accessibility | 15% |
| Strategic fit | 15% |
| Willingness to pay | 10% |
| Switching costs | 10% |

## Market Sizing Methods

| Method | Approach | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Top-Down | Total market, apply filters | TAM estimation |
| Bottom-Up | Unit economics × reachable customers | SOM, revenue planning |
| Value Theory | Total value delivered, capture % | New categories |
| Analog | Comparable market as proxy | Emerging markets |

## Competitive Analysis

| Analysis Type | Focus | Frequency |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| Feature comparison | Product capabilities | Quarterly |
| Pricing analysis | Price points, packaging | Quarterly |
| Positioning audit | Messaging, target audience | Semi-annual |
| GTM analysis | Channels, partnerships, sales motion | Quarterly |
| Financial health | Revenue, growth, funding | Quarterly |

## Win/Loss Analysis

- Interview winners and losers to validate positioning and identify gaps
- Rank decision criteria from buyer interviews
- Track competitor mentions in CRM and call recordings
- Debrief sales team on evaluation process

## Common Pitfalls

- **Analysis paralysis**: Time-box research to 2-4 weeks. Decide at 70% confidence; real market feedback fills the rest.
- **Confirmation bias**: Ask open-ended questions. Interview churned customers. Seek disconfirming data.
- **Static market view**: Refresh competitive intel quarterly. Markets move faster than slide decks.
