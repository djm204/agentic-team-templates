# Stakeholder Notifications

Guidelines for cascading disruption communications to the right people through the right channels at the right time.

## Notification Cascade

| Tier | Timing | Recipients |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Immediate | < 15 min | Operations control center, affected warehouse managers, on-call SC lead |
| Fast | < 1 hour | Procurement (if supplier-related), logistics partners, customer service, VP SC (S1/S2) |
| Standard | < 4 hours | Affected retailers/key accounts, sales team, finance team, exec leadership (S1) |
| Periodic | Daily until resolved | Status update to all previously notified parties |

## Channel Selection

| Stakeholder | S1 | S2 | S3+ |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Executive leadership | Phone + SMS + Email | Email + Dashboard | Dashboard |
| Operations team | SMS + Slack + Dashboard | Slack + Dashboard | Dashboard |
| Warehouse managers | SMS + WMS alert | WMS alert + Email | WMS alert |
| Logistics partners | API + Email + Phone | API + Email | API |
| Retailers/customers | Phone + Email | Email | Email (if ETA changes) |

Higher severity always uses higher-urgency channels. Never send an S1 notification by email alone.

## Content Requirements

Every disruption notification must include:

1. **What happened**: Clear, factual description
2. **What is affected**: Specific routes, shipments, SKUs, or orders
3. **What we are doing**: Actions taken and actions planned
4. **Revised timeline**: Updated ETAs or service level expectations
5. **What they need to do**: Decisions or actions required from the recipient
6. **Next update**: When the next communication will be sent

Avoid jargon with external stakeholders — retailers need delivery dates, not algorithm names.

## Escalation Rules

- No acknowledgment within 30 min (S1) or 2 hrs (S2) → auto-escalate to next level in chain of command
- Three S3+ disruptions affecting same stakeholder in 30 days → proactive resilience review call
- Recovery timeline extends > 50% beyond estimate → immediate updated notification regardless of schedule

## Fatigue Prevention

- **Role-based filtering**: Each role has a severity threshold; do not send below it
- **Aggregation**: Multiple S4/S5 events in same region within 24 hrs → single daily summary
- **Deduplication**: One notification per disruption, not one per detection source
- **Quiet hours**: S4/S5 respect business hours unless they escalate

## Common Pitfalls

- **Notifying everyone about everything**: Match severity to role — executives see only S1/S2
- **Technical jargon in customer comms**: "Your shipment is rerouted, revised delivery is [date]" not AIS vessel data
- **Missing periodic updates**: Send daily updates even if "no change" — silence breeds uncertainty
