# Inventory Rebalancing

Guidelines for maintaining service levels by dynamically redistributing inventory across warehouse networks during disruptions.

## Safety Stock Framework

```text
SS = Z * sigma_demand * sqrt(lead_time) + Z * demand_avg * sigma_lead_time
```

- **Z factor**: 1.65 for 95% service level, 2.33 for 99%
- **Recalculation**: Weekly under normal conditions, daily during active disruptions
- **Disruption buffer**: Additional stock at strategic locations sized for expected disruption duration × daily demand

## Rebalancing Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Stock-out imminent | Days of supply < 3 at any RDC | Emergency transfer from nearest surplus location |
| Demand shift | Regional demand > 120% of forecast for 5+ days | Redistribute from low-demand regions |
| Inbound delay | Shipment ETA pushed > 48 hours | Activate safety stock, pull forward next PO |
| Supplier failure | Supplier set to inactive | Switch to backup supplier, deplete strategic reserve |
| Recovery complete | Routes restored, inbound normalized | Replenish safety stock over 30 days |

## Rebalancing Algorithm

For each SKU at each location, evaluate daily:

1. Calculate days of supply: on-hand ÷ daily demand forecast
2. If below threshold → identify nearest surplus locations, calculate transfer quantity, score by cost and transit time, execute lowest-cost feasible transfer
3. If above maximum → flag for redistribution to deficit locations, reduce inbound orders
4. Adjust demand forecasts and replenishment orders at both origin and destination

## Warehouse Roles

| Type | Role | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| Regional Distribution Center | Primary fulfillment | Highest |
| Forward Stocking Location | Fast delivery, key markets | High |
| Central Warehouse | Bulk storage, overflow buffer | Medium |
| Cross-Dock Facility | Flow-through, no storage | N/A — reroute flows |
| Bonded Warehouse | Pre-customs holding | Low |

## Inventory KPIs

| KPI | Target | Frequency |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Fill rate | > 97% | Daily |
| Days of supply | 7-14 days (SKU-dependent) | Daily |
| Inventory turns | > 8/year | Monthly |
| Dead stock | < 3% of SKUs (zero movement 90 days) | Monthly |
| Rebalancing cost | < 2% of inventory value | Monthly |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Reactive-only**: Trigger rebalancing at the warning threshold, not at stockout
- **Ignoring transfer costs**: Compare transfer cost against revenue risk — small deficits at low-velocity locations may not justify it
- **Static safety stock**: Recalculate weekly; adjust for disruptions, seasonal shifts, and lead time changes
