# Rerouting

Guidelines for automated shipment rerouting when primary routes are disrupted.

## Decision Tree

When a route is blocked or degraded:

1. **Evaluate alternate routes** using the scoring algorithm
2. **Cost delta < 25%**: Auto-approve and execute
3. **Cost delta 25-50%**: Auto-approve with executive notification
4. **Cost delta > 50%**: Hold for human approval (max 4-hour hold)
5. **No alternate route**: Evaluate alternate suppliers or escalate to war room

For potential delays (not yet blocked): delay risk > 48 hrs → preemptive reroute evaluation; < 48 hrs → monitor every 6 hours.

## Route Scoring

| Factor | Weight | Metric |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Transit time | 30% | Hours to destination vs. original ETA |
| Cost | 25% | Incremental cost as % of shipment value |
| Reliability | 20% | Historical on-time rate for this lane |
| Capacity | 15% | Available capacity vs. volume needed |
| Risk exposure | 10% | Known active risk factors on route |

Minimum acceptable composite score: 60/100. Below this, reject and evaluate next alternative.

## Modal Switching

| Original Mode | Fallback 1 | Fallback 2 | Fallback 3 |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Ocean freight | Rail (continental) | Air (high-value) | Truck (regional) |
| Air freight | Express ocean | Truck relay | Charter flight |
| Rail | Truck | Intermodal | Air (critical only) |
| Truck | Rail | Intermodal | Courier (small parcels) |

Air freight reserved for high-value or time-critical shipments where cost premium is justified by revenue at risk.

## Constraints Checklist

Before executing any reroute, verify:

- **Regulatory**: Goods can legally transit all countries on the new route
- **Temperature**: Cold chain integrity maintained across all segments
- **Weight/volume**: New mode and route can handle cargo dimensions
- **Customs**: New transit countries do not add excessive clearance delays
- **Contractual**: No minimum volume commitment violations on original lane
- **Insurance**: Cargo insurance valid for new route and mode

## Rerouting Record

Log every rerouting decision: original route/ETA, disruption trigger, alternatives evaluated with scores, selected alternative and rationale, cost delta, approval status, revised ETA, and actual delivery outcome.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Cheapest route bias**: Use weighted scoring — a $500 cheaper route with 60% on-time rate costs more in the end
- **Rerouting into congestion**: Monitor alternate node capacity; distribute volume across multiple alternatives
- **Forgetting to revert**: Set automated triggers to return to primary routes once disruption resolved and stable for 48+ hrs
