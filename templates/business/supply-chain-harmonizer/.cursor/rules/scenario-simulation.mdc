# Scenario Simulation

Guidelines for stress-testing the supply chain against disruption scenarios to validate playbooks and identify resilience gaps.

## Simulation Pipeline

1. **Define**: Disruption type, severity, duration range, geographic scope, affected nodes
2. **Model**: Current inventory levels, in-transit shipments, supplier capacity, active contracts, demand patterns
3. **Run**: Monte Carlo with 10,000+ iterations, varying duration, demand, and recovery speed
4. **Evaluate**: Service level impact, total cost, recovery timeline, stockout probability, revenue at risk
5. **Recommend**: Optimal playbook, pre-positioning opportunities, investment cases for resilience

## Standard Scenarios

Maintain and rerun on cadence:

| Scenario | Cadence | Key Variables |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Major port closure (7-14 days) | Quarterly | Port, season, demand level |
| Top supplier bankruptcy | Semi-annually | Supplier, replacement lead time |
| Regional natural disaster | Quarterly | Region, severity, duration |
| Trade route blockage (canal/strait) | Semi-annually | Route, diversion options |
| Pandemic-level demand shift | Annually | Demand multiplier, duration |
| Cyberattack on logistics systems | Semi-annually | Systems affected, recovery time |
| Compound multi-event disruption | Annually | Combination of 2-3 scenarios |

## Simulation Parameters

Each run must specify:

- **Disruption duration**: Min, expected, and max values
- **Demand during disruption**: Baseline, increased (panic buying), or decreased
- **Recovery curve**: Linear, exponential, or step-function
- **Capacity constraints**: Alternate route and supplier limits
- **Cost multipliers**: Expedited shipping premiums, surge pricing, penalties

## Output Metrics

Produce at P10, P50, and P90 confidence levels:

- Revenue at risk (sales that cannot be fulfilled)
- Additional logistics cost (rerouting, expediting, modal switching)
- Service level degradation (percentage point drop in fill rate)
- Full recovery time (days to baseline)
- SKU stockout count and customer impact scope

## Playbook Validation

- Run scenario with current playbook active, then with no playbook (baseline)
- Compare outcomes to quantify playbook effectiveness
- Identify gaps where playbook underperforms, update, and rerun to verify

## Simulation Freshness

- Rerun all scenarios when supplier network changes materially
- Update demand inputs quarterly from actual consumption
- Recalibrate disruption probabilities using last 12 months of incident data

## Common Pitfalls

- **Simulating without updating**: Stale data produces dangerous confidence — rerun quarterly with current network data
- **Optimistic duration estimates**: Model tail risk; the P90 duration matters more than P50 for resilience testing
- **Ignoring capacity constraints**: Model real limits on alternates — three customers rerouting through one port creates a new bottleneck
