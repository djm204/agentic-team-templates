# Disruption Response

Guidelines for detecting, classifying, and responding to supply chain disruptions autonomously.

## Detection Pipeline

```text
Ingest → Classify → Correlate → Decide → Record
```

1. **Ingest**: Aggregate data from IoT sensors, AIS tracking, weather services, news feeds, supplier ERPs
2. **Classify**: Map to disruption taxonomy, assign severity S1-S5, estimate duration
3. **Correlate**: Cross-reference with active shipments, map upstream/downstream blast radius
4. **Decide**: Match to response playbook, evaluate rerouting options, trigger action or escalate
5. **Record**: Log full context, start recovery timer, initialize notification cascade

## Severity Levels

| Level | Label | Impact Threshold | Response Mode |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| S1 | Critical | Complete route/supplier loss, > $1M/day | Autonomous containment + immediate escalation |
| S2 | Severe | Major delay > 72 hrs, multiple SKUs | Autonomous reroute + executive notification |
| S3 | Moderate | Delay 24-72 hrs, limited SKU impact | Automated mitigation + manager notification |
| S4 | Minor | Delay < 24 hrs, single shipment | Log and adjust |
| S5 | Watch | Potential disruption, no current impact | Monitor dashboard |

## Response Playbook Structure

Every disruption type maps to a playbook containing:

- **Trigger conditions** and **immediate actions** (autonomous within 30 minutes)
- **Rerouting options**: Pre-scored alternatives ranked by the scoring algorithm
- **Inventory actions**: Rebalancing or safety stock activation steps
- **Notification targets**: Who is informed and when, per the cascade
- **Escalation criteria**: Conditions requiring human decision-making
- **Recovery milestones**: Metrics for progress back to normal operations

## Correlation Rules

When a disruption is detected, correlate against:

- Active shipments on affected routes or from affected suppliers
- Pending purchase orders dependent on disrupted capacity
- Warehouse stock levels for affected SKUs
- Other active disruptions that compound impact
- Seasonal demand factors that amplify or dampen the effect

## Response Timing Targets

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Disruption detected | < 15 min from occurrence |
| Severity classified | < 10 min from detection |
| First autonomous action | < 30 min from detection |
| Stakeholder notification | Per cascade (15 min to 4 hrs) |
| Recovery plan published | < 4 hrs from S1/S2 detection |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Alert without action**: Every detection must trigger a playbook; missing playbooks are gaps to close next simulation cycle
- **Severity inflation**: Over-classifying as S1/S2 causes fatigue — use the matrix consistently
- **Ignoring compound events**: A port delay plus supplier constraint on the same SKU is worse than the sum of parts
