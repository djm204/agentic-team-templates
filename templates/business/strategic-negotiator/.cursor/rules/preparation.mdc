# Preparation

Guidelines for negotiation preparation, counterparty profiling, and pre-negotiation strategy.

## Preparation Checklist

**Self-Assessment**:
- Identify and rank interests (not positions)
- Calculate BATNA and reservation price
- Set target price with justification
- Inventory concessions with internal costs
- Define authority limits and constraints

**Counterparty Analysis**:
- Research their interests, priorities, and BATNA
- Assess constraints, timeline pressures, and decision-making process
- Profile key decision-makers (style, authority, biases)
- Review past negotiation behavior

**ZOPA Construction**:
- Estimate zone of possible agreement
- Identify expansion opportunities
- Prepare multiple package proposals
- Design contingent agreements for uncertainty

**Strategy**:
- Choose opening approach (anchor, listen first, or package)
- Plan concession pattern and pace
- Prepare responses to likely counterparty moves
- Define walk-away criteria; assign team roles

## Counterparty Style Assessment

| Style | Indicators | Counter-Strategy |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Competitive | Positional demands, deadline pressure | Hold firm on walk-away; redirect to interests |
| Collaborative | Interest-based questions, transparency | Reciprocate cautiously; verify claims |
| Avoidant | Delayed responses, delegation | Set deadlines; escalate to decision-makers |
| Analytical | Data requests, detailed due diligence | Prepare rigorous data; expect longer timelines |

## Anchoring Strategy

**Anchor first** when you have strong ZOPA information and want to frame terms. **Let them anchor** when you have limited info and their offer may reveal intelligence.

- Set anchor ambitiously but defensibly (justify with data)
- Use precise numbers ($47.5M, not "around $50M") — precision signals preparation
- Expect 30-50% of distance between anchor and counterparty target as outcome

## Concession Principles

1. Never concede without getting something back
2. Make concessions progressively smaller (signals approaching your limit)
3. Label concessions ("This is important to us, but...")
4. Track all concessions by both sides
5. Never split the difference as a first move

## Team Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Lead negotiator | Primary spokesperson, relationship management |
| Analyst | Real-time modeling, number verification |
| Observer | Read counterparty dynamics, take notes |
| Specialist | Answer technical/legal/financial questions |

## War-Gaming

Simulate before negotiating: assign a red team as counterparty, run 3 rounds of offers/counteroffers, identify weak points, refine responses, practice walk-away.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Underestimating prep time**: Preparation-to-negotiation ratio should be at least 3:1
- **Preparing only your side**: Spend half your prep on counterparty analysis
- **Rigid scripting**: Prepare principles and ranges, not scripts — be adaptive in execution
