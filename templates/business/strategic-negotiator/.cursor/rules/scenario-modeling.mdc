# Scenario Modeling

Guidelines for building quantitative models and stress-testing negotiation strategies.

## Modeling Pipeline

1. **Define the decision**: What negotiation choice does this inform? What precision is needed?
2. **Identify key uncertainties**: List variables, classify as controllable vs. not, rank by impact
3. **Build scenarios**: 2×2 matrix from top two uncertainties; name each; assign probabilities
4. **Model outcomes**: Decision trees for sequential choices, Monte Carlo for continuous uncertainty
5. **Derive strategy**: Identify robust strategies (work across scenarios) and contingent ones (optimal in specific scenarios); define trigger points for shifting

## Decision Tree Construction

- **Root node**: Your opening decision (accept, reject, counter)
- **Chance nodes**: Counterparty responses with estimated probabilities
- **Decision nodes**: Your choices at each stage
- **Terminal nodes**: Final outcomes with dollar values
- **Solve backward**: Calculate expected values from terminal nodes to root

Confidence levels: High (historical data, precedent) → Medium (expert judgment, analogies) → Low (speculation). When low, widen ranges and run more scenarios.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

1. Define input distributions for each uncertain variable
2. Specify correlations between inputs (don't assume independence)
3. Run 10,000+ iterations
4. Analyze as distributions: mean, median, std dev, 5th/95th percentile, probability of loss

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Tornado diagram**: Vary each assumption independently, hold others at base case, rank by swing in outcome. Focus negotiation on the top 3-5 value drivers.

**Two-way table**: For the two most impactful assumptions, build a matrix showing outcome under each combination — reveals dangerous and windfall scenarios.

## Four-Scenario Framework

For each scenario, document: probability, deal value, optimal terms, early warning indicators, contingency response.

- **Robust strategy**: Performs acceptably across all scenarios
- **Contingent strategy**: Optimal in a specific scenario but may fail in others
- **Preferred approach**: Robust base with contingent options (earn-outs, triggers) that activate per scenario

## Stress Testing

Test every proposed structure against:

| Stress Test | Question |
|------------|----------|
| Revenue collapse (-30%) | Does the deal still create value? |
| Synergy failure (50%) | Is the price still justified? |
| Key person loss (month 3) | Are retention terms adequate? |
| Market downturn (-25% multiples) | Is financing safe? |
| Regulatory block (18+ months) | Can both sides sustain? |
| Integration delay (2×) | Cash flow implications? |

## Common Pitfalls

- **False precision**: Present ranges, not point values, when assumptions have ±30% uncertainty
- **Scenario blindness**: Make scenarios genuinely different — worst case should be uncomfortable
- **Anchoring on base case**: Weight all scenarios by probability; a 30% catastrophic downside matters more than a 40% moderate base
