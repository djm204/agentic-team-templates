# Deal Structuring

Guidelines for structuring M&A deals, joint ventures, and complex commercial agreements.

## Valuation Alignment Mechanisms

When buyer and seller disagree on value:

| Mechanism | When to Use | Risk Allocation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Earnouts | Revenue/EBITDA uncertainty | Seller bears performance risk |
| Escrow holdbacks | Representation risk | Seller bears warranty risk |
| Milestone payments | Product/regulatory milestones | Shared execution risk |
| Working capital adjustments | Balance sheet uncertainty | Factual true-up |
| CVRs | Binary event outcomes | Seller retains upside optionality |
| Seller notes | Financing gap | Buyer credit risk to seller |

## Earnout Design Principles

1. **Metric clarity**: Unambiguous, auditable metrics (revenue, not "adjusted EBITDA")
2. **Period**: 12-24 months typical; longer creates more disputes
3. **Operating covenants**: Specify how the business must be run during measurement
4. **Ceiling and floor**: Cap maximum payout; set minimum thresholds
5. **Dispute resolution**: Pre-agree on accounting firm and arbitration

## Indemnification Framework

| Element | Seller-Friendly | Buyer-Friendly | Market Norm |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Cap | 5-10% of deal value | 50-100% | 10-25% |
| Basket threshold | 1.5-2% | 0.25-0.5% | 0.5-1% |
| Survival (general) | 12 months | 36 months | 18-24 months |
| Escrow | 5% for 12 months | 15-20% for 24 months | 8-15% for 18 months |

## Term Trade-Off Strategy

Never negotiate terms in isolation. Use cross-category trades:

| Concession | In Exchange For |
|-----------|----------------|
| Higher purchase price | Stronger rep and warranty package |
| Broader indemnification | Larger escrow with faster release |
| Shorter non-compete | Tighter customer non-solicitation |
| Flexible payment schedule | Stronger MAC clause protections |

Present offers as complete packages (A/B/C options) — forces trade-off evaluation over cherry-picking.

## Tax Structure Considerations

| Structure | Seller Impact | Buyer Benefit |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Asset purchase | Ordinary income on some assets | Step-up in basis |
| Stock purchase | Capital gains treatment | No step-up (unless 338(h)(10)) |
| Tax-free reorg | Deferral of gain | Carryover basis |
| Installment sale | Spread recognition | Deferred payments |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering earnouts**: If you cannot explain it in two sentences, simplify it
- **Ignoring integration in deal terms**: TSAs, retention, system migration are negotiation items, not afterthoughts
- **Single-issue focus**: Negotiate multiple issues simultaneously to enable value-creating trades
