# Game Theory

Guidelines for applying game theory frameworks to business negotiations.

## Game Classification

Before modeling, classify the negotiation:

- **Zero-Sum**: One side's gain is the other's loss → minimax, competitive tactics
- **Non-Zero-Sum**: Value creation possible → Nash bargaining, integrative strategies
- **Sequential**: Moves in order with observation → backward induction, decision trees
- **Simultaneous**: Parties move without seeing other's choice → dominant strategy analysis
- **Repeated**: Same parties negotiate again → tit-for-tat, reputation building
- **Incomplete Information**: Private information → signaling, screening, Bayesian updating

## Payoff Matrix Construction

1. Identify players and their strategy sets (cooperate, compete, concede, walk away)
2. Assign payoff values based on financial modeling, not guesses
3. Identify Nash Equilibria (no player benefits from unilateral deviation)
4. Check for Pareto improvements over the equilibrium
5. Assess stability under pressure

## Key Equilibrium Concepts

| Concept | When to Apply |
|---------|--------------|
| Nash Equilibrium | Predicting likely outcome when both sides act rationally |
| Subgame Perfect | Multi-round negotiations with observable moves |
| Bayesian Nash | Bidding with private valuations |
| Focal Point (Schelling) | Setting anchors or predicting natural convergence |
| Correlated Equilibrium | Mediated negotiations with neutral coordinator |

## Backward Induction

For sequential negotiations: identify the last decision point and optimal choice, work backward to the opening move. Critical for multi-round offers, earn-out negotiations, and phased closings.

## Cooperation vs. Defection

| Situation | Strategy | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| One-time deal, no future relationship | Compete (claim value) | No retaliation risk |
| Ongoing vendor/partner | Cooperate (create value) | Reputation and repeated game |
| Multi-party with coalitions | Strategic cooperation | Build winning coalition |
| Joint venture | Integrate first, then divide | Both sides need the deal |

- **Finite horizon**: Cooperation unravels from the end (backward induction)
- **Indefinite horizon**: Cooperation sustainable if discount factor is high enough

## Signaling and Screening

- **Signaling**: Convey private info credibly — costly signals (capital at risk), commitment devices (public positions), credible deadlines
- **Screening**: Extract private info — menu of options (choice reveals preferences), contingent contracts ("if your projections are right..."), due diligence

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assuming rationality**: Account for bounded rationality, emotions, politics, and principal-agent problems
- **Ignoring repeated game effects**: Aggressive tactics invite retaliation in future negotiations
- **Over-modeling**: Game theory informs strategy but real negotiations involve ambiguity — use models as guides, not scripts
