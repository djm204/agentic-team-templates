# Contract Analysis

Guidelines for analyzing and negotiating contract terms in M&A, commercial, and dispute contexts.

## Contract Review Process

1. **Initial assessment**: Identify type, governing law, parties, key economic terms, termination triggers, non-standard provisions
2. **Risk analysis**: Liability caps, indemnification scope, reps and warranties, MAC clauses, force majeure
3. **Economic analysis**: Total cost modeling, payment timing, contingent payment weighting, hidden costs (transition, compliance)
4. **Operational analysis**: Performance feasibility, SLA achievability, reporting burden, resource commitments
5. **Strategic analysis**: Precedent for future deals, competitive effects, flexibility, exit options

## Key Clause Focus Areas

**Reps and Warranties**: Financial statements, IP ownership, legal compliance, material contracts, employee matters, tax. Negotiate materiality thresholds, knowledge qualifiers, and survival periods.

**MAC Clauses**: Allocate signing-to-closing risk. Key negotiations: breadth of definition, carve-outs (industry-wide, economy-wide), disproportionate impact requirements, duration thresholds.

**Non-Competes**: Assess enforceability by jurisdiction. Balance geographic scope, duration (1-2 years typical), activity scope, and carve-outs. Too broad risks unenforceability.

## Dispute Resolution Selection

| Mechanism | Speed | Privacy | Best For |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| Arbitration | Moderate | High | International deals, confidential matters |
| Litigation | Slow | Low | Injunctive relief, precedent-setting |
| Mediation | Moderate | High | Ongoing relationships, multi-issue disputes |
| Expert determination | Fast | High | Accounting disputes, valuations |

## Red Flags

Flag immediately during review:

- Unlimited liability or uncapped exposure
- Unilateral amendment rights
- Automatic renewal without notice
- Broad assignment rights (unfavorable counterparty risk)
- Vague performance standards
- Missing termination rights
- One-sided indemnification

## Contract Optimization

When renegotiating existing contracts:

1. Benchmark current terms against market
2. Identify asymmetric value (low cost to them, high value to you)
3. Package amendment requests — never cherry-pick single clauses
4. Link amendments to value events (renewals, expansions)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Reading without modeling**: Quantify economic impact of key terms across scenarios
- **Ignoring boilerplate**: Notice, governing law, and assignment clauses control how the contract operates in practice
- **Unenforceable terms**: For every term, ask: can we detect a breach, prove it, and remedy it?
