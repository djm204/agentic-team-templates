# Intelligence Reporting

Guidelines for structuring, delivering, and measuring the impact of intelligence reports.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Flash Alert | As needed | Decision-makers | Critical signals requiring immediate action |
| Daily Brief | Daily | Leadership | Overnight developments and market snapshot |
| Weekly Strategic | Weekly | Senior leadership | Trend analysis, competitive landscape, risk |
| Monthly Deep Dive | Monthly | Cross-functional | Thematic analysis on strategic topics |
| Quarterly Outlook | Quarterly | Exec team/board | Forward-looking trend and risk assessment |

## Daily Brief Structure

- **Priority Alerts**: Severity, source, action required
- **Market Snapshot**: Key indicators, changes, trends
- **Competitive Activity**: Notable competitor moves
- **Emerging Signals**: Description and signal strength
- **Sentiment Summary**: Topic sentiment, volume, changes

## Report Quality Standards

- **Lead with the "so what"**: Start with implications, not data
- **Quantify impact**: Attach revenue, market share, or timeline estimates
- **Include confidence levels**: State certainty and rationale
- **Cite sources**: Every claim links to evidence
- **Recommend action**: End with specific next steps
- **Keep it scannable**: Tables, bullets, bold for key figures

## Distribution Best Practices

- Match detail to audience seniority (execs want summary, analysts want data)
- Use consistent formatting so readers know where to find what
- Set SLAs (daily brief by 8 AM, weekly by Friday noon)
- Track readership to identify unused reports
- Archive for historical pattern analysis

## Measuring Intelligence Impact

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Decision influence | >70% report using intelligence in decisions |
| Signal accuracy | >80% confirmed signals |
| Time advantage | >5 days before mainstream coverage |
| Coverage gaps | <2 missed events per quarter |
| Report utilization | >85% readership |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Data dumps**: Send 50 articles with no synthesis. Instead, curate 3-5 developments with analysis and actions.
- **Static reporting**: Same format regardless of events. Adapt emphasis to current conditions.
- **No feedback loop**: Never ask if reports are useful. Survey consumers quarterly.
