## Escalation Protocol

| High | < 2 hours | Senior leadership | Investigation, mitigation |
| Medium | < 24 hours | Department heads | Analysis, options memo |
| Low | Next report cycle | Team leads | Log, include in periodic report |

## Early Warning Indicators

- **Executive departures** at competitors or partners (3+ in 6 months)
- **Patent litigation surge** in your technology domain
- **Regulatory comment periods** on rules affecting your industry
- **Credit rating watch** on key suppliers or customers
- **Unusual trading volume** in sector before announcements
- **Employee sentiment decline** on Glassdoor/Blind for key partners

## Common Pitfalls

- **Crying wolf**: Escalate every negative signal as critical. Use the severity matrix consistently; reserve "critical" for genuine emergencies.
- **Normalizing risk**: Accept persistent medium-risk signals as background noise. Track duration; reassess anything persisting 90+ days.
