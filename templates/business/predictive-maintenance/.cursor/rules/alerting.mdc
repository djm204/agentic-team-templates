# Alert Management

Guidelines for configuring, routing, and managing predictive maintenance alerts.

## Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Condition | Response Time | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| P1 - Critical | Imminent failure (RUL < 48h) or safety risk | < 1 hour | Stop asset, emergency maintenance |
| P2 - High | Significant degradation (RUL < 2 weeks) | < 8 hours | Schedule urgent maintenance |
| P3 - Medium | Moderate degradation detected | < 48 hours | Plan maintenance in next window |
| P4 - Low | Early degradation signal, trend emerging | Next review | Monitor, add to watchlist |
| P5 - Info | Anomaly detected, no confirmed degradation | Log only | Record for pattern analysis |

## Alert Routing

| Severity | Primary Recipient | Channel |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| P1 | On-shift operator + maintenance lead | SMS + phone + dashboard |
| P2 | Maintenance planner + shift supervisor | Email + dashboard + push |
| P3 | Maintenance planner + asset engineer | Dashboard + email |
| P4 | Asset engineer | Dashboard |
| P5 | Analytics team | Log only |

## Threshold Types

- **Static**: Absolute limits from manufacturer specs (e.g., vibration > 18.0 mm/s = P1)
- **Dynamic**: Adjusted for load, ambient temperature; alert when reading > mean + N std dev
- **Model-based**: RUL drops below threshold, anomaly score exceeds confidence limit, or degradation rate accelerates

## Alert Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| True positive rate | > 80% |
| False alarm rate | < 15% |
| Missed detection rate | < 5% |
| Alert-to-action time | < SLA per severity |

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

- **Suppress duplicates**: Same asset, same condition, within suppression window
- **Aggregate related**: Multiple sensors on one asset = one alert with details
- **Escalate, don't repeat**: Unacknowledged P4 for 48h escalates to P3
- **Tune continuously**: Review false alarms monthly, adjust thresholds quarterly
- **Snooze with accountability**: Temporary suppression requires reason and expiration

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too many P1s**: Tight thresholds to "catch everything" produces 50 daily P1s, all ignored. Reserve P1 for imminent failure or safety risk.
- **Static thresholds on variable assets**: Same vibration limit at 50% and 100% load. Normalize against operating conditions.
