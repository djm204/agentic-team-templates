# Asset Lifecycle Management

Guidelines for tracking assets from commissioning through retirement.

## Lifecycle Stages

```text
Procurement → Installation → Commissioning → Operation → Degradation → Overhaul/Replacement → Retirement
```

## Asset Registry Requirements

Every monitored asset must have:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Asset ID | Unique identifier (e.g., PUMP-WH3-042) |
| Asset class | Equipment category |
| Criticality | Safety/production/standard/non-critical |
| Location | Physical location hierarchy |
| Install date | Commissioning date |
| Expected life | Design life or fleet average |
| Current hours | Operating hours accumulated |
| Maintenance/failure history | Linked records with root cause analysis |
| Sensor mapping | Which sensors monitor this asset |

## Health Index Scoring

| Health Index | Condition | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Monitor at standard frequency |
| 70-89 | Good | Monitor, no action needed |
| 50-69 | Fair | Increase monitoring, plan maintenance |
| 30-49 | Poor | Schedule maintenance in next window |
| 0-29 | Critical | Immediate intervention required |

## Fleet Analytics

- **Survival analysis**: Weibull distribution of time-to-failure across fleet
- **Bad actor identification**: Units with failure rates > 2x fleet average
- **Aging curve analysis**: Health index degradation rate by age cohort
- **Total cost of ownership**: Acquisition + maintenance + downtime + energy

## Replacement Decision Framework

```text
Replace when:
├── Repair cost > 50% of replacement AND asset > 60% of expected life
├── Failure frequency > 3x in 12 months despite maintenance
├── Spare parts becoming obsolete or unavailable
├── Newer technology offers > 20% efficiency gain
└── Safety risk exceeds acceptable threshold
```

## Cost Tracking Per Asset

- **Capital cost**: Purchase and installation
- **Cumulative maintenance**: All preventive and corrective actions
- **Downtime cost**: Lost production attributed to this asset
- **Energy cost**: Operating consumption trends
- **Book value**: Current depreciated value

## Common Pitfalls

- **Treating all assets equally**: Segment by criticality. Safety-critical gets PdM; non-critical can run to failure.
- **Ignoring fleet patterns**: Compare against fleet baselines. Faster-than-peer degradation signals a unique problem.
