# Failure Prediction

Guidelines for building and operating failure prediction models and anomaly detection systems.

## Prediction Approaches

| Approach | Data Required | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Physics-based | Engineering models | Well-understood failure modes |
| Statistical (Weibull, Cox) | Historical failure data | Fleet-level life estimation |
| Machine Learning | Sensor + failure history | Complex multi-sensor patterns |
| Hybrid | All of the above | Critical assets, mixed failure modes |

## Model Development Pipeline

1. Define failure modes and target variable
2. Collect and label historical data (run-to-failure + maintenance records)
3. Engineer features (sensor stats, operating context, time-based)
4. Train and validate (time-series cross-validation)
5. Set classification thresholds (balancing precision vs recall)
6. Deploy with monitoring (drift detection, performance tracking)
7. Retrain on new failure data (continuous improvement loop)

## Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation

- **Similarity-based**: Compare current degradation curve to historical failures
- **Regression-based**: Predict time-to-failure from feature trajectory
- **Threshold-based**: Extrapolate trend to known failure threshold

## Anomaly Detection

| Method | Use Case | Sensitivity |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Statistical (Z-score, IQR) | Single-sensor deviations | Low-Medium |
| Isolation Forest | Multi-sensor anomalies | Medium |
| Autoencoders | Complex pattern deviations | Medium-High |
| LSTM-based | Temporal sequence anomalies | High |

## Model Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Precision | > 85% | % of alerts that are true positives |
| Recall | > 90% | % of actual failures caught |
| Lead time | > 14 days | Average warning before failure |
| False alarm rate | < 5% | Alerts with no confirmed issue |

## Failure Mode Library

Maintain a catalog per asset type:

- **Failure mode**: What breaks (bearing wear, seal leak, winding insulation)
- **Detection signature**: Which sensors and features indicate this mode
- **Typical lead time**: How far in advance degradation is detectable
- **Consequence**: Safety, production, and cost impact

## Common Pitfalls

- **Training on healthy data only**: Include run-to-failure data. If none exists, use accelerated testing or physics simulation.
- **Ignoring operating context**: Normalize sensor readings against load/conditions before applying thresholds.
