# Inventory Management

Frameworks for inventory optimization, classification, and control.

## Core Principle

**Inventory is a buffer against uncertainty.** The goal is the right inventory in the right place at the right time. Over-stocking ties up cash; under-stocking loses sales.

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

```text
EOQ = sqrt((2 x D x S) / H)
  D = Annual demand (units), S = Ordering cost per order, H = Annual holding cost per unit

EOQ is most sensitive to demand; doubling demand increases EOQ by only ~41%.
```

## Reorder Point and Safety Stock

```text
ROP = (Avg Daily Demand x Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Safety Stock (with lead time variability):
  SS = Z x sqrt(LT x sigma_D^2 + D_avg^2 x sigma_LT^2)

Z-values: 90%→1.28  95%→1.65  99%→2.33  99.9%→3.09
```

## ABC/XYZ Classification

- **ABC** (by value): A = top 80% revenue (10-20% SKUs), B = next 15%, C = remaining 5%
- **XYZ** (by demand variability): X (CoV < 0.5, stable), Y (0.5-1.0, variable), Z (> 1.0, sporadic)

**Combined Strategy Matrix**:

| Segment | Strategy | Safety Stock |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| AX | JIT/Kanban, tight control | Low |
| AY | Regular review, moderate buffer | Medium |
| AZ | Custom strategy, close monitoring | High or make-to-order |
| BX/BY | Automated/periodic reorder | Standard |
| BZ | Safety stock buffer | Above average |
| CX/CY | Min-max automation, batch ordering | Minimal to standard |
| CZ | Consider elimination or stock on demand | High or drop |

## Cycle Counting

- **A items**: Monthly, 99.5% accuracy target
- **B items**: Quarterly, 97% accuracy target
- **C items**: Semi-annually, 95% accuracy target
- Always investigate root causes of discrepancies (receiving, picking, system timing, damage, shrinkage)

## Warehouse Optimization

- Place high-velocity (A) items near shipping dock at waist height
- Place low-velocity (C) items in far zones, upper/lower racks
- Slot frequently co-picked items in adjacent locations
- Target KPIs: space utilization 80-90%, pick accuracy > 99.5%, dock-to-stock < 24 hrs

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring variability**: Using average demand without standard deviation for safety stock leads to chronic stockouts
- **One-size-fits-all policies**: Apply differentiated strategies per ABC/XYZ segment
- **Static safety stock**: Recalculate quarterly as demand patterns and lead times change
