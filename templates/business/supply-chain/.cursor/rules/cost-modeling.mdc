# Cost Modeling

Guidelines for total cost analysis, landed cost calculation, and make-vs-buy decisions.

## Core Principle

**Unit price is never the full cost.** Every decision must be evaluated on total cost of ownership. Hidden costs in quality, risk, inventory carrying, and administration often exceed visible price differences.

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

```text
TCO = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Hidden Costs

Direct:   Purchase price, transportation, customs duties, packaging
Indirect: Ordering costs, inspection, carrying costs (15-30%/yr), quality costs, admin
Hidden:   Disruption risk, currency exposure, tied-up capital, compliance overhead
```

**Inventory carrying cost** is typically 15-30% of average inventory value per year (capital 8-15%, storage 3-5%, insurance 1-2%, obsolescence 2-5%, damage/shrinkage 1-3%).

## Landed Cost

```text
Landed Cost = Product Cost + International Freight + Insurance (0.3-0.5% CIF)
            + Customs Duties (value x rate per HS code) + Brokerage Fees
            + Domestic Transport + Handling/Warehousing
```

Landed cost typically exceeds product cost by 15-30% for international sourcing. Check FTA eligibility (USMCA, CPTPP, RCEP) for duty reduction — requires qualifying rules of origin and proper documentation.

## Make-vs-Buy Decision

| Factor | Favors Make | Favors Buy |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Strategic importance | Core competency | Commodity/non-core |
| IP protection | High sensitivity | Low risk |
| Quality control | Need direct control | Supplier capability proven |
| Volume flexibility | Stable, predictable | Variable or scaling |
| Capital requirement | Equipment exists | Significant investment needed |

Compare total make cost (materials + labor + depreciation + overhead) against total buy cost (purchase + freight + inspection + carrying + supplier management + quality risk).

## Should-Cost and Target Costing

- **Should-cost**: Decompose product into materials, labor, overhead at market rates to validate supplier quotes
- **Target costing**: Market price − required margin = maximum allowable cost; design to that target
- If quote significantly exceeds should-cost → investigate overpricing, missing inputs, or supplier inefficiency

## Financial Analysis

```text
NPV = -Investment + SUM(Annual Savings / (1 + r)^t)
Payback Period = Investment / Annual Savings
```

Classify savings: hard (P&L impact), soft (cost avoidance), productivity (time savings). Avoid double-counting across departments. Benchmark against market price trends, not just prior year.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Unit price comparison instead of TCO**: A cheaper supplier requiring 4x safety stock and 3x defect rate is more expensive overall
- **Ignoring carrying costs**: Volume discount savings must exceed the additional carrying cost of excess inventory
- **Static models**: Update cost models quarterly with current rates, volumes, and market conditions
