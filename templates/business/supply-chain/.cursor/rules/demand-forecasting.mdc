# Demand Forecasting

Guidelines for accurate demand planning using statistical, causal, and collaborative methods.

## Core Principle

**All forecasts are wrong; the goal is to be less wrong and plan for uncertainty.** Combine quantitative methods with market intelligence and measure accuracy rigorously.

## Method Selection

| Pattern | Recommended Method |
|---------|-------------------|
| Flat, stable | Simple moving average or simple exponential smoothing |
| Upward/downward trend | Holt's double exponential smoothing |
| Trend + seasonality | Holt-Winters or seasonal ARIMA |
| Complex patterns | ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning |
| New product (no history) | Analogous product comparison or expert judgment |

- **Exponential smoothing alpha**: 0.1-0.3 for stable demand, 0.4-0.6 for volatile
- **Causal models**: Use regression when external factors (price, promotions, weather, economic indicators) clearly drive demand

## Collaborative Forecasting (CPFR)

1. Generate statistical baseline from historical data
2. Sales adjusts for known opportunities and risks
3. Marketing adds promotional lifts and launches
4. Finance aligns with revenue targets and budget constraints
5. Supply chain adjusts for capacity constraints and lead times
6. Executive consensus sign-off on final demand plan

Track whether human adjustments improve or hurt accuracy. Document all adjustment rationale.

## Accuracy Metrics

```text
MAPE = (1/n) x SUM(|Actual - Forecast| / Actual) x 100
  < 10% excellent, 10-20% good, 20-30% acceptable for volatile items

Bias = SUM(Actual - Forecast) / SUM(|Actual - Forecast|)
  Near 0 = balanced, positive = under-forecasting, negative = over-forecasting

wMAPE = SUM(|Actual - Forecast|) / SUM(Actual) x 100
  Better for products with varying volumes
```

## Demand Sensing

Use near-real-time signals to adjust short-term (1-6 week) forecasts:

- **POS/sell-through data** (daily): 1-7 day adjustment window
- **Order pipeline** (real-time): 1-14 day direct input
- **Web traffic/search trends** (daily): 7-21 day correlation
- **Weather forecasts** (3-10 days): product-specific regression
- **Economic releases** (monthly): 30-90 day index adjustment

Use traditional forecasting for planning horizon, demand sensing for execution horizon.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Wrong aggregation level**: Forecast at the level decisions are made (SKU-location for replenishment)
- **Mixing base and events**: Decompose history into base demand + promotional lift + one-time events
- **Forecasts as targets**: Statistical forecast and sales targets are different; conflating them corrupts both
