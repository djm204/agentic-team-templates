# Logistics

Guidelines for transportation management, route optimization, and freight cost control.

## Core Principle

**Logistics is the physical execution of supply chain strategy.** Every decision balances speed, cost, reliability, and compliance.

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Cost/kg | Transit | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Ocean FCL | $0.02-0.05 | 14-45 days | Bulk, non-urgent intercontinental |
| Rail | $0.03-0.08 | 3-15 days | Heavy goods, continental |
| Truck FTL | $0.05-0.15 | 1-5 days | Full loads, regional/national |
| Truck LTL | $0.10-0.30 | 2-7 days | Partial loads, regional |
| Air | $1.00-5.00 | 1-3 days | Urgent, high-value, perishable |

**Quick decision**: Urgent (< 3 days) → Air. Large (> 10K lbs) → FTL/rail. Intercontinental non-urgent → Ocean. High value density (> $50/kg) justifies air.

## Route Optimization

- **Milk runs**: Consolidate multiple supplier pickups into one circuit — 40-60% cost reduction
- **Hub-and-spoke**: Consolidate at regional hubs to reduce long-haul shipments; trade-off is added handling time
- **Last-mile**: Route optimization software (-15-25% fuel), delivery windows (-10-15% failed deliveries), locker/pickup points (-30-40% per delivery cost)

## Freight Cost Management

Key cost drivers: base rate (60-70%), fuel surcharge (10-15%), accessorials (5-10%), insurance, admin fees.

- Consolidate shipments to fill containers (15-25% savings)
- Negotiate volume contracts (10-20%)
- Shift to slower modes when lead time permits (50-80%)
- Right-size packaging to minimize dimensional weight (5-15%)
- Audit 100% of freight invoices — industry error rate is 3-5%

**Dimensional weight**: Billable weight = MAX(actual weight, L×W×H ÷ DIM factor). Oversized packaging inflates costs.

## Customs Essentials

- Classify products correctly by HS/HTS code — wrong codes risk penalties and duty overpayment
- Required docs: commercial invoice, packing list, bill of lading, certificate of origin
- Key Incoterms: EXW (buyer pays all), FOB (seller to port), CIF (seller pays freight+insurance), DDP (seller pays all)
- Retain records 5-7 years for audit compliance

## Carrier Management

- Allocate volume: primary carriers 60-70%, secondary 20-30%, spot market 5-10%
- Score carriers on: on-time delivery (25%), pickup (20%), claims ratio (20%), invoice accuracy (15%), communication (10%), rate (10%)
- Review annually through competitive bid; rebalance quarterly on scorecard

## Common Pitfalls

- **Default mode selection**: Analyze mode options per shipment rather than defaulting to "what we've always done"
- **Ignoring DIM weight**: Right-size packaging to avoid paying for air you're shipping
- **Single carrier dependency**: Maintain 2-3 qualified carriers per lane for competitive tension and resilience
