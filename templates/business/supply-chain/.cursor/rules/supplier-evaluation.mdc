# Supplier Evaluation

Guidelines for supplier selection, performance management, and relationship development.

## Core Principle

**Suppliers are partners, not adversaries.** Measure performance objectively, communicate expectations clearly, develop strategic suppliers for long-term advantage.

## Scorecard Framework

| Category | Weight | Key Metrics |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Delivery | 30% | On-time delivery rate, lead time consistency, fill rate |
| Quality | 30% | Defect rate, first-pass yield, CAPA responsiveness |
| Cost | 25% | Price vs market benchmark, YoY cost reduction, invoice accuracy |
| Service | 15% | Communication responsiveness, flexibility, innovation |

**Scoring**: 9-10 Excellent, 7-8 Good, 5-6 Acceptable, 3-4 Below Standard, 1-2 Unacceptable

**Classification actions**:
- **Strategic** (8.5-10): Long-term agreements, joint planning, innovation collaboration
- **Preferred** (7.0-8.4): Volume growth consideration, development programs
- **Approved** (5.0-6.9): Standard management, improvement expectations set
- **Probation** (3.0-4.9): Formal improvement plan, monthly reviews, volume reduction
- **Exit** (< 3.0): Transition to alternative supplier

## RFQ Process

1. Define requirements — specs, quality, volume projections, delivery, commercial terms
2. Identify 3+ qualified suppliers (existing approved, referrals, trade contacts)
3. Issue standardized RFQ with evaluation criteria and weights
4. Normalize bids, score against criteria, create comparison matrix
5. Negotiate total value (not just price) with shortlisted 2-3 suppliers
6. Award, execute contract, onboard, conduct first article inspection

## Dual-Sourcing Strategy

- **70/30 split**: Primary (best cost/quality) 70%, secondary (geographic diversity) 30%
- **Dynamic allocation**: Rebalance quarterly based on scorecard within 60/40 to 80/20 range
- Dual-source mandatory when: stockout revenue impact > $50K/week, few qualified suppliers, lead times > 6 weeks, high geographic concentration

## Quality Audits

| Type | Frequency | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| Pre-qualification | Once | Before supplier approval |
| Routine | Annual | All ongoing suppliers |
| For-cause | As needed | After quality events |
| Process | Bi-annual | Critical component lines |

## Supplier Development

- **Strategic** (top 5% by spend): Joint improvement teams, co-investment, quarterly business reviews
- **Key** (top 20%): Training programs, quarterly reviews, development targets
- **Standard** (all others): Scorecard feedback, annual review

## Common Pitfalls

- **Price-only evaluation**: Use TCO — a $0.50/unit savings with 3% defects vs 0.2% often costs more overall
- **Infrequent reviews**: Score quarterly, review monthly for critical suppliers, share results promptly
- **No consequences**: Clear escalation path — warning at 6.0, probation at 4.0, exit plan at 3.0
