# Supplier Evaluation

Guidelines for supplier selection, performance management, and relationship development.

## Core Principle

**Suppliers are partners, not adversaries.** The best supply chains are built on transparent, mutually beneficial relationships with rigorously evaluated suppliers. Measure performance objectively, communicate expectations clearly, and develop strategic suppliers for long-term advantage.

## Supplier Scorecard Framework

### Performance Categories

| Category | Weight | Key Metrics |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Delivery | 30% | On-time delivery, lead time consistency |
| Quality | 30% | Defect rate, first-pass yield, CAPA responsiveness |
| Cost | 25% | Price competitiveness, cost reduction initiatives |
| Service | 15% | Communication, flexibility, innovation |

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | Exceeds expectations consistently |
| 7-8 | Good | Meets expectations with minor gaps |
| 5-6 | Acceptable | Meets minimum requirements |
| 3-4 | Below Standard | Frequent issues requiring intervention |
| 1-2 | Unacceptable | Failing to meet requirements |

## Dual-Sourcing Strategy

### When to Dual-Source

| Factor | Single Source OK | Dual Source Required |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Revenue impact of stockout | Low (< $50K/week) | High (> $50K/week) |
| Number of qualified suppliers | Many (5+) | Few (2-3) |
| Supplier financial risk | Low | Medium-High |
| Geographic concentration | Diverse region | Single region/country |
| Lead time | Short (< 2 weeks) | Long (> 6 weeks) |
| Custom/proprietary | Off-the-shelf | Highly customized |

### Volume Allocation Models

```text
Model 1: 70/30 Split
  Primary:   70% (best cost/quality)
  Secondary: 30% (geographic diversity)

Model 2: 60/40 Split
  Primary:   60% (incumbent)
  Secondary: 40% (challenger to drive competition)

Model 3: Dynamic Allocation
  Allocate based on rolling scorecard performance
  Quarterly rebalancing within 60-40 to 80-20 range
```

## Supplier Development Programs

### Development Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Investment |
|------|----------|------------|
| Strategic | Top 5% by spend, critical components | Joint improvement teams, co-investment |
| Key | Top 20% by spend | Training programs, quarterly business reviews |
| Standard | All other approved suppliers | Scorecard feedback, annual review |

### Quarterly Business Review Agenda

```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Evaluating on Price Alone

```markdown
Wrong: "Supplier B is $0.50 cheaper per unit, switch immediately"
Right: "Supplier B is $0.50 cheaper but has 3% defect rate vs 0.2%,
        and lead time is 2 weeks longer. TCO analysis shows Supplier A is 8% cheaper overall."
```

### 2. Infrequent Scorecard Reviews

```markdown
Wrong: Review supplier performance annually
Right: Score quarterly, review monthly for critical suppliers, share results promptly
```

### 3. No Consequences for Poor Performance

```markdown
Wrong: Supplier stays at same volume despite declining quality
Right: Clear escalation path: warning at 6.0, probation at 4.0, exit plan at 3.0
```

### 4. Over-Consolidating to One Supplier

```markdown
Wrong: "Give 100% to Supplier A for maximum volume discount"
Right: "Maintain qualified secondary source for critical items;
        the risk premium of single-sourcing exceeds the volume discount"
```

### 5. Ignoring Sub-Tier Suppliers

```markdown
Wrong: "Our supplier is in Germany, so no geographic risk"
Right: "Our supplier is in Germany, but their key raw material comes from
        a single source in a high-risk region. Map the full supply chain."
```

### 6. Treating All Suppliers the Same

```markdown
Wrong: Same review process for $10M strategic supplier and $5K office supply vendor
Right: Segment suppliers by spend and criticality; invest management time proportionally
```
