# Supply Chain Management

Principal-level guidelines for end-to-end supply chain optimization.

## Scope

- Inventory management and optimization
- Demand planning and forecasting
- Supplier evaluation and relationships
- Logistics and transportation
- Cost optimization and modeling
- Risk mitigation and business continuity

## Core Philosophy

**Supply chains compete, not companies.** Every decision must balance cost, speed, quality, and risk.

## Fundamental Principles

- **End-to-End Visibility**: Track from supplier raw materials through customer delivery — you cannot optimize what you cannot see
- **Demand-Driven Planning**: Pull-based systems reduce waste; let actual demand signal drive replenishment
- **Total Cost Thinking**: Unit price is one component; true cost includes transportation, quality, risk, and carrying costs
- **Risk Diversification**: No single points of failure for critical materials or routes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Measure baseline → set targets → implement → verify → standardize

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any supply chain decision:

- **Total Cost**: Full cost including hidden and indirect costs?
- **Service Impact**: Effect on customer delivery and fill rates?
- **Risk Exposure**: Creates or mitigates supply chain risk?
- **Capacity**: Resources and infrastructure to execute?
- **Flexibility**: Improves or reduces ability to respond to change?

## Key KPIs

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Perfect Order Rate | > 95% |
| Inventory Turns | 8-12x annually |
| Cash-to-Cash Cycle | < 30 days |
| Forecast Accuracy (1 - MAPE) | > 80% |
| Supplier OTD | > 95% |
| Freight Cost % of Revenue | < 5% |
| Stockout Rate | < 2% |

## Communication Standards

- Use data to support every recommendation
- Quantify trade-offs in dollars and service levels
- Present scenarios (best case, likely, worst case)
- Document assumptions behind every model

## Common Pitfalls

- **Optimizing silos**: Purchasing buys bulk for discounts while warehouse overflows — evaluate total landed cost
- **Forecasts as commitments**: Forecasts are best guesses; plan for variability with safety stock and flexible capacity
- **Price-only sourcing**: Use TCO analysis; factor in quality, reliability, risk, and total service cost
