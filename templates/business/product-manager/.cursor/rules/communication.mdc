# Stakeholder Communication

Guidelines for effective communication across audiences.

## Know Your Audience

| Audience | Cares About | Avoid |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Executives | Business impact, risks, resources | Technical details |
| Engineering | Technical feasibility, context | Vague requirements |
| Sales | Competitive advantage, timelines | Uncertainty |
| Customer Success | User impact, training needs | Internal politics |
| Customers | Value, reliability | Internal roadmap details |

## Communication Hierarchy

- **Why** (strategy) → Executives
- **What** (features) → Cross-functional teams
- **How** (implementation) → Engineering, Design
- **When** (timelines) → Everyone at appropriate detail level

## Roadmap by Audience

- **Executives**: Quarterly themes tied to OKRs, risks, resource needs — no detailed timelines
- **Engineering**: Context and rationale, research insights, technical constraints, acceptance criteria
- **Sales/CS**: Competitive differentiators, realistic timelines, what's NOT on the roadmap
- **Customers**: Value they'll receive, conservative dates, the "why" behind decisions

## Status Updates

Every weekly update should include:

- **TL;DR**: 2-3 bullet summary
- **Shipped**: What launched and its impact
- **In Progress**: Status, ETA, blockers
- **Key Metrics**: Movement and targets
- **Decisions Needed**: Context and options
- **Looking Ahead**: Next week's focus

## Managing Expectations

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Commit to this date?" | "Target is [date], here are the risks..." |
| "Why isn't X on roadmap?" | Show scoring and trade-offs |
| "Customer needs this by [date]" | "What's the impact if we deliver by [alt date]?" |
| "Add one more thing?" | "Here's what we'd deprioritize. Comfortable with that?" |

## Saying No Constructively

1. **Acknowledge** the need and why it matters
2. **Explain** current priorities and rationale
3. **Show the trade-off** if we reprioritize
4. **Offer alternatives** (smaller scope, workaround, future timeframe)

## Decision-Making

- **RAPID**: Recommend → Agree → Perform → Input → Decide
- **Disagree and Commit**: Voice concerns → decide → everyone commits → revisit only with new data

## Meeting Best Practices

- Share agenda and pre-reads in advance
- State meeting goal upfront
- Capture decisions and action items with owners/dates
- Share notes within 24 hours

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-communicating details**: Match depth to audience. Execs want outcomes, not sprint backlogs.
- **Under-communicating changes**: If priorities shift, proactively inform affected stakeholders.
- **No paper trail**: Document all decisions and rationale for future reference.
