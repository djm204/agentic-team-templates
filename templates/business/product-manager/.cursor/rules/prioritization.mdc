# Prioritization

Frameworks for evidence-based prioritization. Every "yes" is an implicit "no" to something else.

## RICE Framework

```text
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

| Factor | Description | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Reach | Users affected in time period | Number per quarter |
| Impact | Effect on each user | 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive) |
| Confidence | Certainty in estimates | 50% (low) to 100% (high) |
| Effort | Resources required | Person-months |

### Impact Scale

- **3 (Massive)**: Core workflow, users would churn without it
- **2 (High)**: Important workflow, meaningful improvement
- **1 (Medium)**: Noticeable but not critical
- **0.5 (Low)**: Minor, some users benefit
- **0.25 (Minimal)**: Edge case, rarely noticed

## Alternative Frameworks

- **Value vs Effort Matrix**: Quick wins (high value, low effort) first; avoid time sinks (low value, high effort)
- **Kano Model**: Must-have → Performance → Delighters → Indifferent → Reverse
- **MoSCoW**: Must / Should / Could / Won't for release scoping
- **ICE**: Impact × Confidence × Ease (1-10 each) — simpler than RICE for quick decisions

## When to Override Scores

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Security vulnerability | Immediate priority regardless of score |
| Regulatory compliance | Non-negotiable timeline |
| Tech debt blocking features | Elevate priority |
| Strategic partnership | Weigh relationship value |

## Technical Debt & Bug Prioritization

- Allocate 15-20% of capacity to tech debt
- Prioritize by: Blocking → Slowing → Risk → Maintainability
- Bugs: P0 (drop everything) → P1 (this sprint) → P2 (near term) → P3 (backlog) → P4 (if time)

## Stakeholder Request Triage

1. **Acknowledge**: "I understand this is important"
2. **Understand**: What problem? Who affected? Impact of not doing?
3. **Evaluate**: Score against framework, compare to roadmap
4. **Respond**: Show trade-offs with data
5. **Document**: Record request, evaluation, and decision

## Common Pitfalls

- **Recency bias**: Latest request always wins. Use consistent scoring.
- **HiPPO**: Exec requests skip the queue. Score all requests equally.
- **Analysis paralysis**: Set decision deadlines and move forward.
- **Stale backlog**: Regular grooming — review weekly, reassess quarterly.
