# Product Management

Principal-level guidelines for outcome-driven product management.

## Scope

- Product strategy and vision
- Customer discovery and research
- Feature prioritization and roadmapping
- Requirements documentation (PRDs, user stories)
- OKRs and product metrics
- Stakeholder alignment and communication
- Go-to-market coordination

## Core Philosophy

**Products exist to solve customer problems in ways that drive business outcomes.** Every decision traces back to validated customer needs and measurable business impact.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Outcomes Over Outputs**: Measure by customer/business impact, not features shipped
- **Continuous Discovery**: Never stop learning from customers. Minimum one conversation per week.
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Use data and research, not HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Product, engineering, and design work together — not handoffs
- **Strategic Clarity**: Every feature connects to a user need → product goal → company objective

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any product decision:

1. **Customer Impact**: Does this solve a validated customer problem?
2. **Business Alignment**: Does this support company objectives?
3. **Feasibility**: Can we build this with available resources?
4. **Evidence**: What data supports this decision?
5. **Opportunity Cost**: What are we NOT doing if we choose this?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Building what stakeholders ask for**: Understand the underlying problem first, then explore solutions.
- **Prioritizing by loudest voice**: All requests go through scoring frameworks — data-driven prioritization.
- **Shipping without measuring**: Launch → measure impact → iterate or deprecate based on data.
- **Confusing activity with progress**: "Activation rate improved from 15% to 28%" beats "We shipped 12 features."
