# Product Discovery

Guidelines for continuous customer discovery and research.

## Core Habits

- **Interview customers weekly** — minimum one conversation per week
- **Synthesize learnings** — update opportunity trees weekly
- **Test assumptions constantly** — validate before building; product trio (PM, Designer, Engineer) co-owns discovery

## Opportunity Solution Trees
```text
            [Desired Business Outcome]
                      │
         ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    [Opportunity] [Opportunity] [Opportunity]
         │
    ┌────┼────┐
  [Sol] [Sol] [Sol]
    │
[Assumption Tests]
```

1. Start with outcome: what metric are we moving?
2. Map opportunities: what customer needs drive the outcome?
3. Generate solutions: multiple ways to address each opportunity
4. Test assumptions: what must be true for each solution to work?

## Customer Interviews

### Interview Types

| Type | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Exploratory | Understand problem space | Early discovery |
| Problem | Validate specific problems | Opportunity assessment |
| Solution | Test solution concepts | Before building |
| Usability | Evaluate existing solutions | During/after building |

### Structure (30 min)

- **Opening (2 min)**: Purpose, consent, no wrong answers
- **Context (5 min)**: Role, typical day, current tools
- **Problem exploration (15 min)**: Last time they experienced [problem], what happened, workarounds, frequency
- **Impact (5 min)**: Cost in time/money/frustration, what would change if solved
- **Closing (3 min)**: Anything else, referrals, follow-up permission

### The Mom Test

- Ask about past behavior, not hypotheticals ("Tell me about the last time..." not "Would you use...")
- Ask about actions, not opinions ("What have you tried?" not "Is this a good idea?")
- Ask about actual spend, not willingness ("What do you pay now?" not "Would you pay $50?")

## Assumption Testing

| Type | Question |
|------|----------|
| Desirability | Will customers want this? |
| Viability | Will this work for the business? |
| Feasibility | Can we build this? |
| Usability | Can users figure it out? |

Test high-risk assumptions cheaply first (fake doors, landing pages, interviews), then invest more (prototypes, MVPs, betas).

## Research Methods

- **Qualitative** (5-15 participants): Interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies
- **Quantitative** (100+): Surveys, A/B tests, analytics, card sorting

## Common Pitfalls

- Leading questions — ask open-ended, focus on problems before solutions
- Only happy customers — include churned and frustrated users
- Discovery as a phase — it's an ongoing practice, not a one-time project
