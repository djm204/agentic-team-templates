# Requirements Documentation

Standards for PRDs, user stories, and specifications.

## Core Principles

- Requirements are **living documents** — they evolve through collaboration
- Include **rationale**, not just requirements
- Match detail to audience: executives (outcomes), trio (problems/solutions), engineering (criteria)

## PRD Structure

Every PRD should contain:

- **Problem Statement**: Customer problem in their words, with evidence (interviews, analytics, tickets)
- **Goals & Success Metrics**: Primary/secondary KRs with baselines, targets, and measurement method
- **User Stories**: With acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- **Scope**: In scope, out of scope, future considerations
- **Technical Considerations**: Dependencies, approach, performance/security requirements
- **Timeline**: Milestones with owners and dates
- **Risks & Mitigations**: Likelihood, impact, actions
- **Open Questions**: With assigned owners

## User Story Format
```gherkin
As a [persona/role],
I want to [action/goal],
So that [benefit/value].

Given [precondition],
When [action taken],
Then [expected result].
```

## INVEST Criteria

Good user stories are:

- **I**ndependent — can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable — details can be discussed
- **V**aluable — delivers value to user or business
- **E**stimable — can be sized by the team
- **S**mall — completable in one sprint
- **T**estable — has clear pass/fail criteria

## Story Sizing

| Size | Points | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| XS | 1 | Well-understood, < 1 day |
| S | 2 | Minimal unknowns, 1-2 days |
| M | 3 | Some complexity, 3-5 days |
| L | 5 | Multiple components, ~1 week |
| XL | 8+ | Too large — must be split |

## Edge Cases to Document

- **Empty/error states**: No data, loading, no results, network failure, permission denied, invalid input
- **Boundaries**: Maximum items, character limits, minimum values
- **Concurrency**: Multiple users editing, stale data

## Review Checklist

- Problem stated with evidence
- Success metrics defined and measurable
- User stories meet INVEST, acceptance criteria are testable
- Edge cases documented, dependencies identified
- Risks assessed, timeline realistic, open questions have owners

## Common Pitfalls

- PRDs in isolation — collaborate with engineering and design from day one
- Vague acceptance criteria — "Dashboard works" is not testable; use Given/When/Then
- Missing non-goals — explicitly state what this project will NOT address
