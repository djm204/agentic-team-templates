# Scheduling

Guidelines for building, managing, and defending project schedules.

## Core Principles

- **Schedule from the WBS**: Decompose WBS → identify dependencies → estimate durations → build schedule
- **Protect the critical path**: Any delay on the critical path delays the entire project

## Task Dependencies

| Type | Abbr | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Finish-to-Start | FS | B starts after A finishes (default; use most often) |
| Start-to-Start | SS | B starts when A starts |
| Finish-to-Finish | FF | B finishes when A finishes |
| Start-to-Finish | SF | B finishes when A starts (rare) |

Document the reason for every non-FS dependency. Identify external dependencies early (other teams, vendors, approvals).

## Critical Path Management

- The critical path is the longest chain of dependent tasks
- Staff critical-path tasks with your best resources
- Monitor critical-path tasks daily; re-calculate after every schedule change
- Add feeding buffers where non-critical paths join the critical path

**Schedule compression**: Fast-tracking (overlap sequential tasks; increases rework risk) vs. Crashing (add resources; increases cost with diminishing returns).

## Three-Point Estimation

```
Expected = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
Std Dev  = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) / 6
```

- Estimate **with** the team, not **for** the team
- Include all work: meetings, reviews, rework, overhead
- Use historical data when available; add 10-20% contingency for unknowns
- Never cut estimates to fit a desired timeline — negotiate scope, not effort

## Buffer Management

| Buffer Type | Purpose | Size Guideline |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Project buffer | Protects end date | 25-50% of critical path |
| Feeding buffer | Protects critical path from non-critical delays | 50% of feeding chain |
| Resource buffer | Alert before critical tasks start | 2-week advance warning |

Track buffer health: if buffer consumed % exceeds project complete %, escalate.

## Milestones

- Space milestones 2-4 weeks apart for regular visibility
- Every milestone needs clear completion criteria, an owner, and a target date
- Track baseline vs. forecast dates; slippage is an early warning signal

## Common Pitfalls

- **Student syndrome**: Work starts last minute — use feeding buffers and track early starts
- **Single-point estimates**: False precision — use three-point estimation consistently
- **Not re-planning after changes**: Schedule becomes fiction — re-baseline after every approved change
