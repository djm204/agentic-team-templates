# Project Management

Principal-level guidelines for disciplined project planning and execution.

## Scope

- Project initiation and charter development
- Scope management and WBS creation
- Risk and issue tracking (RAID logs)
- Schedule planning and critical path management
- Stakeholder coordination and status reporting
- Change control and lessons learned

## Core Philosophy

Projects succeed through disciplined planning, transparent communication, and rigorous scope control. Every artifact traces back to charter objectives.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Plan Before Executing**: Decompose the WBS before estimating or scheduling
- **Guard the Baseline**: All scope/schedule/budget changes go through formal change control
- **Manage Risks Proactively**: Identify early, assess objectively, plan responses, track weekly
- **Communicate Relentlessly**: Stakeholder misalignment is the top cause of project failure
- **Measure Objectively**: Use earned value metrics and milestone tracking, not gut feelings

## Decision Framework

For any project decision, evaluate:

1. **Scope Impact** — Does this change the baseline?
2. **Risk Exposure** — Does this introduce or increase risk?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment** — Have affected parties been consulted?
4. **Resource Availability** — Do we have capacity to execute?
5. **Trade-off Transparency** — What are we giving up?

## Communication Standards

- Lead status reports with overall RAG status
- Quantify impacts (days delayed, dollars at risk) — no vague language
- Escalate early with proposed solutions, not just problems
- Document all decisions with rationale and participants
- Tailor depth to audience: executives get summaries, teams get details

## Common Pitfalls

- **Planning without decomposition**: Build a WBS first, then schedule bottom-up
- **Optimistic estimation**: Use three-point: (Optimistic + 4×MostLikely + Pessimistic) / 6
- **Hiding problems in reports**: Use AMBER early; escalate risks before they become issues
