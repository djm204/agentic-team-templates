# Stakeholder Management

Guidelines for identifying, engaging, and aligning project stakeholders.

## Core Principles

- Stakeholder misalignment is the top cause of project failure — this is a core PM discipline
- PMs influence without authority: build trust through competence and transparency

## Stakeholder Mapping (Power/Interest Grid)

- **High Influence + High Interest**: Manage closely (sponsor, key decision-makers)
- **High Influence + Low Interest**: Keep satisfied (senior sponsors who delegate)
- **Low Influence + High Interest**: Keep informed (end users, support teams)
- **Low Influence + Low Interest**: Monitor (peripheral stakeholders)

## RACI Matrix Rules

- Exactly **one A** (Accountable) per activity — the person with final authority
- At least **one R** (Responsible) per activity — the person doing the work
- Limit **C** (Consulted) to those whose input is truly needed
- Use **I** (Informed) for awareness without requiring a response
- Review RACI at kickoff; reference it when conflicts arise; update when roles change

**Anti-patterns**: Too many C's (decision paralysis), A without authority, R without capacity.

## Communication Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Right message, right audience | Executives get summaries; teams get details |
| No surprises | Share bad news early with a proposed response |
| Two-way dialogue | Listen as much as you communicate |
| Written confirmation | Follow up verbal decisions with email summary |
| Consistent cadence | Stakeholders should know when to expect updates |

## Managing Difficult Stakeholders

| Behavior | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Disengaged sponsor | Brief focused updates; escalate only critical items |
| Scope expander | Redirect to change control; show schedule/budget impact |
| Micromanager | Provide detailed status proactively; agree on escalation triggers |
| Resistant to change | Understand concerns; involve in decisions; show evidence |
| Conflicting priorities | Facilitate alignment meeting; use objective prioritization |

## Expectation Management

- Define success criteria upfront — written, measurable, agreed upon
- When expectations must change: acknowledge the original plan, explain what changed, present options with trade-offs, recommend and ask for a decision

## Engagement Health Metrics

| Metric | Healthy | Warning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Meeting attendance | > 80% | < 50% |
| Decision turnaround | < 3 days | > 7 days |
| Feedback response | Within 2 days | > 5 days |
| Escalation frequency | Rare | Weekly |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring silent stakeholders**: Proactively engage all identified stakeholders to prevent last-minute objections
- **RACI created but not used**: Reference it when conflicts arise; review quarterly
- **No communication plan**: Create a formal plan with cadence, format, and owners per stakeholder
