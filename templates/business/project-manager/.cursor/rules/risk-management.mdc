# Risk Management

Guidelines for identifying, assessing, and responding to project risks.

## Risk vs. Issue

- **Risk**: Uncertain future event — plan a response before it happens
- **Issue**: Problem that has already occurred — resolve it now
- Good risk management prevents most issues

## Risk Identification

Key techniques: brainstorming at kickoff, checklist review at phase gates, expert interviews, assumption analysis, lessons learned from past projects.

**Risk statement format**: "Due to [cause], [risk event] may occur, resulting in [impact]." Bad: "Vendor might be late." Good: "Due to the vendor's limited platform experience, integration may need custom development, resulting in a 3-week delay and $15K cost."

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Score = Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-5)**

| Score Range | Priority | Review Frequency |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 15-25 | Critical | Daily |
| 10-14 | High | Twice weekly |
| 5-9 | Medium | Weekly |
| 1-4 | Low | Bi-weekly |

For high-value projects, supplement with Expected Monetary Value (Probability × Dollar Impact) or Monte Carlo simulation.

## Response Strategies (Threats)

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Avoid** | Can eliminate the threat | Use proven tech instead of experimental |
| **Transfer** | Shift to third party | Fixed-price contract, insurance |
| **Mitigate** | Reduce probability or impact | Cross-train team, add prototyping phase |
| **Accept (Active)** | Risk is manageable | Reserve budget/schedule buffer |
| **Escalate** | Beyond PM authority | Raise to sponsor |

For opportunities: Exploit, Enhance, Share, or Accept.

## Risk Response Essentials

Every risk response must document:
- Response actions with owners and due dates
- Trigger indicators (what signals the risk is materializing)
- Contingency plan (what to do if the risk occurs despite response)
- Residual risk after response is implemented

## Risk Review Cadence

- **Weekly** (15 min in standup): Review open risks, check for new risks, assess triggers
- **Monthly** (30 min): Re-assess all scores, review response effectiveness, report to sponsor

## Issue Escalation

- **Team level** (1-2 days): PM and team attempt resolution
- **Functional management** (3-5 days): Escalate to department heads
- **Sponsor** (within 1 week): Budget increases, major scope changes
- **Executive** (same day): Project cancellation risk, regulatory issues

## Common Pitfalls

- **Risks identified but never reviewed**: Schedule weekly risk reviews — a stale register is useless
- **No risk owners**: Every risk needs an individual owner who acts on it
- **All risks scored "medium"**: Calibrate scoring with concrete criteria to differentiate
