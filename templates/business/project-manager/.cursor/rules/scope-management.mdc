# Scope Management

Guidelines for defining, decomposing, and protecting project scope.

## Core Principles

- **Triple Constraint**: Scope, schedule, and budget are interconnected — changing one affects the others. Make trade-offs explicit.
- **100% Rule**: The WBS must capture 100% of project work, including PM activities. If it is not in the WBS, it is not in the project.

## WBS Decomposition

- **Level 0**: Project → **Level 1**: Phases/deliverables → **Level 2**: Sub-deliverables → **Level 3**: Work packages
- Work packages should be 8-80 hours, assignable to one person/team, with clear completion criteria
- Organize by **deliverables**, not activities — "User research report" not "Meetings"

## Scope Statement Essentials

Every scope statement must include:

- Measurable objectives derived from the charter
- Deliverables with acceptance criteria
- Explicit **in-scope** and **out-of-scope** lists
- Documented assumptions and constraints

## Change Request Process

1. **Log** the request on a change request form
2. **Assess impact** on scope, schedule, budget, risk, quality, and dependencies
3. **Present options** — approve, modify, defer, or reject
4. **Obtain decision** from change board or sponsor
5. **Update baseline** if approved; revise all affected plans
6. **Communicate** changes to all affected stakeholders

## Scope Creep Prevention

| Red Flag | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Can we also add..." | Log as change request; assess impact first |
| "It should be easy to..." | Verify with the team before committing |
| "We assumed this was included" | Check scope statement and WBS |
| Undocumented verbal agreements | Document and run through change control |

Prevention strategies: detailed scope statement, WBS walkthrough at kickoff, formal change control, monthly scope reviews, requirements traceability matrix.

## Deliverable Acceptance

- Define measurable acceptance criteria per deliverable before work begins
- PM submits deliverable → stakeholder reviews against criteria → approve, revise, or reject
- Document sign-off with date and reviewer name

## Requirements Traceability

- Every requirement links to at least one WBS work package
- Orphan work packages (no requirement) indicate scope creep
- Orphan requirements (no work package) indicate missing work

## Common Pitfalls

- **Gold plating**: Team adds unrequested features — review deliverables against scope statement
- **Vague scope**: Constant disagreements — be explicit about in-scope AND out-of-scope
- **No acceptance criteria**: Endless revision cycles — define measurable criteria upfront
