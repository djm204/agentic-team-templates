# Status Reporting

Guidelines for transparent, actionable project reporting and dashboards.

## Core Principles

- **Report for decisions, not documentation**: If nobody will act on it, don't include it
- **Bad news early**: GREEN → AMBER (with mitigation) → GREEN, never GREEN → GREEN → suddenly RED

## RAG Status Framework

| Status | Definition | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| GREEN | On track — within tolerance | Continue monitoring |
| AMBER | At risk — approaching limits, PM action underway | Stakeholder awareness |
| RED | Off track — beyond tolerance | Sponsor/steering committee intervention |

### Tolerance Thresholds

| Dimension | GREEN | AMBER | RED |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|
| Schedule | Within 5% | 5-15% deviation | > 15% |
| Budget | Within 5% | 5-10% deviation | > 10% |
| Scope | No uncontrolled changes | Minor changes under review | Significant uncontrolled changes |
| Resources | Fully staffed | Minor gaps with mitigation | Key roles unfilled |

## Weekly Status Report Structure

1. **Executive summary** (2-3 sentences — lead with the most important item)
2. **Status by dimension** (schedule, budget, scope, quality, resources) with RAG + trend arrows
3. **Key accomplishments** this period
4. **Planned activities** next period
5. **Top 3 risks and issues** with owners and actions
6. **Milestone tracker** (baseline vs. forecast dates)
7. **Decisions needed** with context and deadline
8. **Budget summary** (budget, spent, forecast, variance)

## Earned Value Basics

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Schedule Variance (SV) | EV - PV | Negative = behind schedule |
| Cost Variance (CV) | EV - AC | Negative = over budget |
| SPI | EV / PV | < 1.0 = behind schedule |
| CPI | EV / AC | < 1.0 = over budget |
| Estimate at Completion | BAC / CPI | Projected total cost |

Use EVM for multi-month projects with defined budgets and schedules.

## Audience-Specific Reporting

| Audience | Content | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Steering Committee | Strategic status, escalations | Monthly |
| Sponsor | Health, risks, budget | Weekly |
| Project Team | Tasks, blockers, dependencies | Daily/Weekly |
| External Stakeholders | Milestones, deliverables | As agreed |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Watermelon reporting**: Green outside, red inside — mandate dimension-level RAG, not just overall
- **Reports without action**: Require a "Decisions Needed" section in every report
- **Too much detail for executives**: Separate executive summary from detailed report
