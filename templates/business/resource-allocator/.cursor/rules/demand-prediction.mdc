# Demand Prediction

Guidelines for forecasting resource demand across multiple time horizons.

## Forecasting Pipeline

Data Collection → Feature Engineering → Model Selection → Validation → Deployment → Monitoring

## Methods by Horizon

| Horizon | Methods | Update Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Immediate (0-4h) | Exponential smoothing, trend extrapolation | Every 15-30 min |
| Short-term (4-24h) | ARIMA, gradient boosting with real-time features | Every 1-2 hours |
| Medium-term (1-7d) | Prophet, SARIMA with calendar features | Daily |
| Long-term (1-12mo) | Regression, demographic trends, scenario planning | Weekly to monthly |

## Demand Signal Categories

- **Deterministic**: Scheduled events, seasonal patterns, regulatory deadlines — capture with near-perfect accuracy
- **Stochastic**: Walk-ins, equipment failures, emergencies — model with probability distributions, not point estimates
- **Shock events**: Disasters, pandemics — cannot predict with time-series; handle with scenario planning and crisis protocols

## Accuracy Targets

| Metric | Target | Action if Missed |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| MAPE (4-hour) | < 15% | Review features, check data quality |
| MAPE (24-hour) | < 20% | Add external features |
| Bias | Within ±3% | Recalibrate; check for process changes |
| Peak detection | > 90% | Add leading indicators |
| False alarm rate | < 10% | Increase confirmation requirements |

## Key Predictors

- **Time features**: Hour, day of week, month, holiday flags
- **Weather**: Temperature extremes, precipitation, severe warnings
- **Events**: Local events, school calendars, sports schedules
- **Lagged demand**: Same hour yesterday, same day last week, same period last year
- **Upstream signals**: Emergency call volumes, referral rates, pre-hospital data
- **Capacity state**: Current utilization may suppress apparent demand (censoring)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing demand with throughput**: Throughput is demand filtered by capacity — adjust for censoring when at capacity
- **Ignoring regime changes**: Monitor for structural breaks; weight recent data more heavily or segment by regime
- **Point forecasts without uncertainty**: Always provide prediction intervals (e.g., "42 arrivals, 80% CI [35, 51]")
