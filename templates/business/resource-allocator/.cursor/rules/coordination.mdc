# Multi-Site Coordination

Guidelines for managing resource allocation across multiple locations and organizational units.

## Coordination Models

| Model | Best For | Key Risk |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Centralized | Uniform demand, high mobility | Single point of failure |
| Federated | Heterogeneous sites, local autonomy | Resource hoarding, slow mutual aid |
| Hierarchical | Large geographic areas, tiered services | Information delays |
| Hybrid | Multiple operating modes | Complexity in mode transitions |

Most organizations benefit from hybrid: federated normally, centralized during crisis.

## Shared Visibility Requirements

All sites must have real-time access to:

- Resource status (available, deployed, reserved) by type per site
- Demand state (utilization, queue lengths, wait times)
- Transfer activity with ETAs
- Crisis level at each site
- Forecast outlook for next 4-12 hours

Without shared visibility, coordination degrades to phone calls and guesswork.

## Mutual Aid Protocols

**Activation**: Lending site < 75% utilization, borrowing site > 90% or unmet demand, travel time acceptable.

**Process**: Formal request → identify lending site → confirm availability → dispatch with tracking → receiving site confirms arrival → both log for reconciliation.

**Recall**: Lending site retains recall authority if own demand escalates (30-minute notice except life-safety).

## Communication Standards

Use standardized formats for inter-site messaging:

- **Request**: Resource type, quantity, urgency, destination, duration
- **Offer**: Type, quantity, available from, transit time
- **Status**: Site, crisis level, utilization by type, key gaps
- **Handoff**: Resource ID, condition, assigned task, contact

| Condition | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Normal | Every 4 hours or on significant change |
| Elevated | Every 2 hours |
| Surge/crisis | Hourly or more frequently |

## Load Balancing Strategies

- **Geographic**: Route to nearest site with capacity
- **Capability-based**: Route specialized cases to matching expertise
- **Utilization-based**: Direct to least-loaded site
- **Equity-based**: Rotate high-burden assignments to prevent overloading

## Common Pitfalls

- **Parochial optimization**: Reward system-level cooperation, not local hoarding
- **Excessive coordination overhead**: Pre-authorize routine transfers; reserve heavyweight process for high-stakes moves
- **Inconsistent data**: Standardize definitions and formats across all sites before attempting coordination
