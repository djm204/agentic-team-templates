# Personnel Scheduling and Shift Optimization

Guidelines for building staff schedules that balance coverage, fairness, and human endurance.

## Scheduling Layers

- **Strategic** (months): Headcount planning, hiring pipeline, training, leave allocation
- **Tactical** (weeks): Shift rosters, on-call rotations, overtime pre-authorization
- **Operational** (hours/real-time): No-show backfill, demand-driven redeployment, crisis activation

## Hard Constraints (never violate)

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Max shift length (e.g., 12h) | Fatigue degrades safety |
| Min rest between shifts (e.g., 10h) | Recovery prevents errors |
| Weekly hour limits (e.g., 60h) | Regulatory compliance, burnout prevention |
| Min staffing ratios per shift | Regulatory and safety floor |
| Certification match | Only qualified personnel in certified positions |

## Soft Constraints (optimize toward)

- Shift preference honoring > 80%
- Seniority balance across shifts
- Overtime equity among willing staff
- Team continuity > 70% same composition

## Fatigue Risk Levels

- **Green**: Standard shifts, adequate rest
- **Yellow**: Extended shift or short turnaround — monitor closely
- **Orange**: Consecutive extended shifts — restrict safety-critical tasks
- **Red**: Approaching regulatory limits — mandatory stand-down

## Schedule Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Coverage ratio | 100% of minimum staffing |
| Overtime percentage | < 8% of total hours |
| Vacancy fill time | < 4 hours for critical roles |
| Schedule stability | < 15% post-publication changes |
| Preference satisfaction | > 80% |

## Backfill Protocol

1. Check internal float pool
2. Offer overtime to qualified on-site staff (respect fatigue limits)
3. Activate on-call personnel
4. Request cross-site transfer
5. Engage agency/contract staff (pre-approved roster)
6. Escalate to operations manager if unfilled; document gap and risk

## Common Pitfalls

- **Treating people as interchangeable**: Match certifications, experience, and team dynamics
- **Ignoring fatigue in crisis**: Rotate rest periods even during surges — fatigued responders compound crises
- **Optimizing only for cost**: Multi-objective: cost, coverage, fatigue, equity, satisfaction
