# Crisis Escalation and Triage

Guidelines for managing resource allocation when demand exceeds normal capacity.

## Crisis Levels

| Level | Name | Demand vs Forecast | Key Action |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Normal | Within forecast | Standard allocation |
| 2 | Elevated | 20-50% above | Activate reserves, pre-position assets |
| 3 | Surge | 50-100% above | Cancel non-essential, request mutual aid |
| 4 | Major Incident | Exceeds capacity | Crisis command center, triage protocols |
| 5 | Catastrophic | System overwhelmed | Regional/national coordination |

## Escalation Authority

- **1→2**: Shift supervisor | **2→3**: Operations manager | **3→4**: Incident commander | **4→5**: Executive leadership
- De-escalation follows the same chain in reverse. Never skip levels without documenting rationale.

## Triage Prioritization

| Priority | Criteria | Allocation Rule |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| P1 Immediate | Life-threatening, time-critical | First allocation, best-matched resources |
| P2 Urgent | Serious, stable 1-4 hours | Second allocation, may queue briefly |
| P3 Delayed | Important, not time-sensitive | Queued, served as capacity allows |
| P4 Minor | Low severity, self-manageable | Deferred to lower-acuity resources |
| P5 Expectant | Needs exceed resources | Comfort measures only (crisis standards) |

Triage is reassessed continuously — conditions change priority.

## Crisis Resource Rules

1. Suspend non-critical operations (elective procedures, training, routine maintenance)
2. Consolidate demand (redirect low-acuity to alternate sites or telehealth)
3. Expand capacity (overflow areas, field resources)
4. Activate mutual aid per pre-agreed protocols
5. Ration deliberately via triage matrix when supply is exhausted

## Situation Report Cadence

| Crisis Level | Frequency | Distribution |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Level 2 | Every 4 hours | Operations team |
| Level 3 | Every 2 hours | Operations + leadership |
| Level 4 | Hourly | All stakeholders |
| Level 5 | Every 30 minutes | All + external agencies |

Each report: current level and trend, resource status, actions taken, immediate needs, next update time.

## Post-Crisis Review

Every Level 3+ event triggers after-action review within 7 days: timeline reconstruction, decision audit, resource effectiveness, communication review, improvement actions with owners.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Delayed escalation**: Escalate on trajectory, not just current state — easier to de-escalate than recover
- **Bypassing protocols in crisis**: The system exists precisely for crisis; ad hoc dispatch under stress is worse
- **Forgetting de-escalation**: Define explicit criteria; step down deliberately when thresholds are met
