# Regulatory Monitoring

Guidelines for continuous scanning of regulatory sources and detecting changes across jurisdictions.

## Source Reliability Tiers

| Tier | Source Type | Authority |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Official gazettes, enacted statutes | Definitive |
| 2 | Regulatory agency final rules | Very High |
| 3 | Proposed rules, comment periods | High |
| 4 | Agency guidance, staff bulletins | Medium-High |
| 5 | Industry analysis, legal commentary | Medium |
| 6 | Political signals, rumored shifts | Low — speculative |

## Monitoring Schedule

| Source | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Federal/national registers | Daily |
| Enforcement actions against peers | Daily |
| Agency announcements | Daily |
| Legislative bill tracking | Weekly |
| Guidance documents and FAQs | Weekly |
| International regulatory developments | Weekly |
| Industry standards updates | Monthly |

## Horizon Scanning

Look beyond current regulations to anticipate future requirements:

- **Proposed legislation**: Track bills through committee and floor votes
- **Regulatory agendas**: Review semi-annual agency agendas
- **Enforcement trends**: Increasing enforcement signals stricter rules ahead
- **International precedent**: Regulations in one jurisdiction often spread
- **Industry incidents**: Breaches and scandals trigger regulatory responses

## Change Detection Signals

| Signal | Strength | Response |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Final rule in official register | Definitive | Begin implementation assessment immediately |
| Proposed rule with comment period | Strong | Assess impact; prepare comment if warranted |
| Enforcement action against peer | Strong | Self-assess against cited violations |
| Legislative bill introduced | Moderate | Add to tracking; assess if it advances |
| Agency leadership speech | Moderate | Note as directional indicator |
| Media speculation | Weak | Log; do not act until corroborated |

## Alert Escalation

| Level | Trigger | Response Time |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Critical | Final rule affecting core operations | < 24 hours |
| High | Enforcement in our sector or proposed rule with direct impact | < 48 hours |
| Medium | Guidance update or standard change | Within 1 week |
| Low | Informational, adjacent industry | Next reporting cycle |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Alert fatigue**: Classify rigorously; reserve high-priority for actionable changes; bundle informational items into digests
- **Jurisdictional blind spots**: Map all jurisdictions where the organization operates; monitor each government level
- **Monitoring without action**: Every detected change must flow into the assessment pipeline within defined response time
