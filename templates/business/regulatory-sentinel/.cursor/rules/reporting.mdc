# Compliance Reporting

Guidelines for structuring compliance reports and maintaining audit readiness.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Regulatory Change Alert | As needed | Compliance team, affected units |
| Compliance Status Dashboard | Weekly | Leadership |
| Gap Analysis Report | Monthly | Business unit leads |
| Regulatory Horizon Report | Quarterly | Executive team |
| Audit Readiness Assessment | Quarterly | Audit committee |
| Annual Compliance Report | Annual | Board of directors |

## Dashboard Requirements

Every compliance dashboard must include:

- Overall compliance score as a percentage
- Status by domain (privacy, financial, health/safety, employment)
- Critical items with owners and deadlines
- Upcoming regulatory changes with effective dates and readiness
- Remediation progress for open gaps

## Report Quality Standards

- **Lead with risk**: Start with critical exposures, not routine metrics
- **Quantify exposure**: Penalty amounts, enforcement likelihood, business impact
- **Cite regulation**: Every claim references a specific provision
- **Include actions**: What needs to happen, who owns it, by when
- **Keep it scannable**: Tables, status indicators, clear headings

## Audit Readiness

Maintain continuous readiness across four areas:

- **Documentation**: Policies current, procedures aligned, evidence retained
- **Controls**: Tested within assessment period, failures remediated
- **Governance**: Committee minutes documented, roles assigned, escalation paths current
- **Response plan**: Exam response team identified, document request procedures rehearsed

## Effectiveness Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Gap closure rate | > 90% within target timeline |
| Regulatory change response time | < 5 business days to assessment |
| Audit findings | Decreasing trend |
| Training completion | > 95% on time |
| Policy currency | 100% reviewed on schedule |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Reporting without insight**: Focus on posture, gaps, and actions — not restating what the law says
- **Static reporting**: Adapt emphasis to current risk; lead with imminent changes or approaching audits
