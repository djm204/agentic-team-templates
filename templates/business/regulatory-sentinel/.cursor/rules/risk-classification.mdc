# Risk Classification

Guidelines for classifying, scoring, and prioritizing regulatory compliance risks.

## Risk Matrix

| | Low Severity | Medium | High | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **High Likelihood** | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| **Med Likelihood** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low Likelihood** | Low | Low | Medium | High |

## Severity Criteria

| Factor | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|--------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Financial penalty | < $100K | $100K-$1M | $1M-$10M | > $10M |
| Operational disruption | Minimal | Moderate | Multi-unit | Enterprise-wide |
| License risk | None | Warning | Conditional restriction | Revocation |
| Reputational exposure | Internal | Trade press | Regional media | National media |
| Customer impact | None | Inconvenience | Service degradation | Breach or harm |

## Composite Risk Scoring

```
Score = Severity (1-4) × Likelihood (1-3) × Velocity (1-3)
Range: 1-36

Critical (24-36): Immediate executive attention
High (12-23): Senior management within 48 hours
Medium (4-11): Compliance team manages monthly
Low (1-3): Log and review quarterly
```

## Risk Velocity

| Velocity | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Immediate | No warning | Unannounced examination |
| Fast | Days to weeks | Enforcement after complaint |
| Moderate | Weeks to months | Proposed rule finalized |
| Slow | Months to years | Gradual industry trend |

## Prioritization Process

1. **Catalog** all compliance risks from gap analysis and monitoring
2. **Classify** using severity and likelihood matrix
3. **Score** with composite formula including velocity
4. **Rank** by composite score, highest first
5. **Allocate** resources to highest-ranked risks
6. **Review** quarterly or on material regulatory change

## Risk Acceptance

Residual risk may be accepted only when:

- Cost of full compliance dramatically exceeds exposure
- Legal counsel has reviewed and documented the rationale
- Senior leadership has formally approved
- Acceptance is time-bound with a reassessment date

Never accept critical-severity obligations.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Uniform treatment**: Use the matrix to differentiate — critical risks get immediate attention, low risks get quarterly review
- **Static scores**: Reassess at least quarterly as enforcement trends shift and controls degrade
- **Ignoring velocity**: High-velocity risks need faster response even at lower severity
