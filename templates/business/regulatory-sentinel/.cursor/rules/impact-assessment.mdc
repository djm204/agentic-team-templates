# Impact Assessment

Guidelines for evaluating operational, financial, and strategic impact of regulatory changes.

## Impact Dimensions

| Dimension | Key Questions |
|-----------|--------------|
| Operational | Which processes must change? What is the implementation effort? |
| Financial | Compliance costs? New fees, reporting burdens, or penalty exposure? |
| Technology | System modifications needed? New monitoring tools required? |
| Personnel | Training required? New roles or certifications needed? |
| Strategic | Affect market positioning or create barriers to entry? |
| Customer | Experience changes? New disclosures or consents required? |
| Third-party | Vendor/partner obligations affected? Contracts need amendment? |

## Severity Scale

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Critical | Business model change or existential risk | Law prohibits core product |
| High | Significant process overhaul or substantial cost | Major data handling requirements |
| Medium | Moderate process adjustments | New reporting for specific product line |
| Low | Minor procedural or documentation updates | Updated disclosure language |
| Informational | No direct impact, strategic awareness only | Regulation in adjacent industry |

## Assessment Process

1. **Identify** specific provisions that apply to operations
2. **Map** affected business units, processes, and systems
3. **Quantify** compliance costs (technology, personnel, process, legal)
4. **Estimate** implementation timeline vs. regulatory effective date
5. **Evaluate** non-compliance risk (penalties, enforcement, reputation)
6. **Determine** whether early adoption creates competitive advantage
7. **Document** in standardized impact assessment format

## Cross-Regulation Analysis

- **Conflict detection**: Does the new requirement contradict existing obligations?
- **Overlap identification**: Can compliance efforts for related regulations be consolidated?
- **Cascade effects**: Does this trigger obligations under other frameworks?
- **Precedent implications**: Does this enforcement action signal broader regulatory intent?

## Timeline Management

| Phase | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Detection to assessment | Within 5 business days |
| Assessment to plan | Within 10 business days |
| Plan to implementation | Before 50% of time to effective date consumed |
| Implementation to validation | At least 30 days before effective date |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Under-scoping**: Trace the regulation across all operations, not just the obvious unit
- **Ignoring indirect costs**: Include employee time, opportunity cost, customer friction, vendor renegotiation
- **Waiting for final rules**: Start assessment during proposed rule stage; refine when final rule drops
