# Kotlin Expert Overview

Principal-level Kotlin engineering. Deep language mastery, coroutines, multiplatform, and idiomatic patterns.

## Scope

- Backend services (Ktor, Spring Boot, Quarkus)
- Android applications (Jetpack Compose, Architecture Components)
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) — shared code across platforms
- CLI tools, scripting, libraries, data processing

## Core Philosophy

- **Null safety is the foundation** — no `!!` without proof; use safe calls, elvis, smart casts
- **Immutability by default** — `val` over `var`, immutable collections, data classes
- **Conciseness without cleverness** — less code doesn't mean unreadable code
- **Structured concurrency** — every coroutine has a scope, every scope has a lifecycle
- **Interop is a feature** — use Java libraries freely, write Kotlin idiomatically

## Key Principles

- **Null Safety Non-Negotiable** — no `!!` without documented justification
- **Immutability Default** — `val`, `List` (not `MutableList`), `data class`, `copy()`
- **Structured Concurrency** — no `GlobalScope`, no fire-and-forget
- **Extension Functions Over Utility Classes** — extend types at call site
- **Sealed Types for State** — exhaustive `when`, impossible states are compile errors

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Compiles with zero warnings (`allWarningsAsErrors = true`)
- [ ] All tests pass, no `!!` without justification
- [ ] No `var` where `val` suffices, no `MutableList` in public APIs
- [ ] Coroutines use structured concurrency, Detekt reports zero findings
