# Research Workflow

Rules for integrating knowledge synthesis into the research process.

## Research Phases

| Phase | Knowledge Action | System Feature |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Question Formation | Search for prior thinking | Semantic search, graph browse |
| Literature Review | Ingest and classify sources | Ingestion pipeline |
| Reading | Create literature notes, summarize | Note creation, highlighting |
| Analysis | Create permanent notes, link to graph | Zettelkasten, graph |
| Synthesis | Build topic summaries, concept maps | Summarization hierarchy |
| Writing | Retrieve and cite from knowledge base | Citation manager, search |
| Revision | Update notes with new understanding | Version tracking |
| Publication | Export bibliography, archive project | Export, archival |

## Daily Routine (30-45 min)

- **Morning (15 min):** Process fleeting notes inbox, review 3-5 random notes via spaced repetition, check documents awaiting ingestion
- **During work:** Capture fleeting notes without interrupting deep work, create literature notes while reading, link new notes immediately
- **Evening (15 min):** Process remaining fleeting notes, update structure notes, log one "idea of the day"

## Weekly Review (60-90 min)

- **Inbox zero:** All fleeting notes processed, documents classified, highlights converted
- **Graph maintenance:** Link/archive orphan notes, merge duplicates, update structure notes
- **Summarization:** Write or update one topic summary, promote mature notes
- **Reflection:** What surprised me? What contradicted prior understanding? What to explore next?

## Note Processing Rules

- **Fleeting notes:** Process within 48 hours or archive. Never link directly to graph.
- **Literature notes:** One per key idea (not per source). Own words, never copy-paste. Linked to bibliographic record.
- **Permanent notes:** Atomic (one idea), self-contained, at least one link to another permanent note, versioned with creation date and update log.

## Version Tracking

When understanding changes: create new version (don't overwrite), add change log entry (date, what changed, trigger), link to previous version, update incoming links, mark old version as superseded (never delete).

## Project Lifecycle

**Starting:** Search existing notes, create project structure note, identify knowledge gaps, build targeted reading list, track project notes separately.

**Completing:** Promote valuable project notes to permanent, archive the rest, update affected topic summaries, export bibliography, write brief retrospective.
