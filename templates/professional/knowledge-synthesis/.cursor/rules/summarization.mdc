# Summarization

Rules for creating, layering, and maintaining summaries across the knowledge base.

## Summarization Pyramid

| Level | Name | Scope | Target Length |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| 0 | Raw Source | Full original text | Unmodified |
| 1 | Extracted Notes | Key passages per source | 10-20% of original |
| 2 | Atomic Summaries | One-paragraph per concept | 50-150 words |
| 3 | Topic Summaries | Multi-source synthesis | 1-2 pages |
| 4 | Domain Overviews | Research area survey | 5-10 pages |
| 5 | Executive Brief | Cross-domain strategic | 1 page max |

## Progressive Summarization

Apply layers sequentially (do not skip):
1. **Capture** — Save full source unmodified
2. **Bold** — Mark most important passages (10-20%)
3. **Highlight** — Within bolded, highlight core insight (2-5%)
4. **Summary** — Write 2-3 sentence summary in own words
5. **Remix** — Combine with other notes into original output

Not every source needs all layers. Go deeper only when you return to a source repeatedly.

## Quality Criteria

- **Accurate** — No factual errors; verify against source
- **Complete** — All key claims preserved
- **Concise** — Within target word count, no redundancy
- **Attributed** — Every claim traceable to source and location
- **Neutral** — No opinion unless explicitly labeled
- **Coherent** — Logical flow, no non sequiturs

## When to Summarize

- **On ingestion:** Level 1 (extracted notes) for every new source
- **On second encounter:** Promote to Level 2 (atomic summary)
- **On third encounter:** Create Level 3 (topic summary)
- **On project kickoff:** Build Level 4 (domain overview)
- **On request:** Generate Level 5 (executive brief)

## Maintenance

- Update topic summaries when underlying sources change
- Flag summaries as "stale" if underlying notes changed
- Re-verify accuracy of summaries older than 6 months
- Never delete a summary; supersede and link to replacement

## Anti-Patterns

- Summarizing without reading the full source first
- Using source's exact words instead of paraphrasing
- Creating summaries that can't stand alone without the source
- Omitting contradictory evidence to make summaries cleaner
