# Grant Writing Development Guide

Principal-level guidelines for securing funding through strategic grant writing, proposal development, budget justification, compliance management, and post-award stewardship.

---

## Overview

This guide applies to:

- Funding opportunity identification and research
- Proposal narrative development
- Logic models and theories of change
- Budget creation and justification
- Federal and foundation compliance
- Review criteria alignment
- Letters of support coordination
- Post-award management and reporting

### Key Principles

1. **Funder Alignment First** - Only pursue opportunities that match your organization's mission and capacity
2. **Evidence-Based Narratives** - Every claim must be supported by data, research, or documented need
3. **Review Criteria Obsession** - Write to the rubric, not around it
4. **Budget as Narrative** - Every dollar tells a story about program impact
5. **Compliance is Non-Negotiable** - Regulations exist for a reason; build them into your process from day one

### Core Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Logic Model | Map inputs to outcomes visually |
| Theory of Change | Articulate causal pathway to impact |
| SMART Goals | Define measurable, achievable objectives |
| Needs Assessment | Document and quantify the problem |
| Evaluation Plan | Design measurement strategy |
| Sustainability Plan | Demonstrate long-term viability |

├── Abstract / Project Summary (1 page)
├── Table of Contents
├── Project Narrative
│   ├── Statement of Need (15-20% of narrative)
│   ├── Goals and Objectives (10-15%)
│   ├── Methods / Project Design (25-30%)

├── Letters of Support / MOUs
├── Appendices
│   ├── Organizational chart
│   ├── Resumes of key personnel
│   ├── Data tables
│   └── Citations
└── Certifications and Assurances
```

### Statement of Need

The need statement establishes why the project matters. It must be data-driven and specific.

```markdown
## Need Statement Structure

### Geographic and Demographic Context
- Define the service area with specificity
- Cite census data, community surveys, or agency reports
- Identify the target population with demographic detail

### Problem Documentation
- Present 3-5 data points that quantify the problem
- Use recent data (within 3-5 years)
- Compare local data to state/national benchmarks
- Include qualitative evidence (community voice, stakeholder input)

### Gap Analysis
- What services currently exist?
- Where do current services fall short?
- What is the unmet need?
- What happens if nothing changes?

### Connection to Project
- How does this project address the documented gaps?
- Why is this approach appropriate for this community?
```

**Good Need Statement:**
```
In Westfield County, 34% of children ages 0-5 live in households
below 200% of the federal poverty level (ACS 2023), compared to
22% statewide. Despite this elevated need, the county has only
two licensed childcare centers serving 120 children, leaving an
estimated 450 children without access to quality early education
(County Needs Assessment, 2024). Families report average wait
times of 14 months for childcare placement (Parent Survey, n=187).
```

**Bad Need Statement:**
```
Many children in our area need help. There aren't enough programs
to serve them. We believe our program will make a difference.
```

### Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes

```
Goal (Broad, aspirational)
├── Objective 1 (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
│   ├── Activity 1.1
│   ├── Activity 1.2
│   └── Expected Outcome 1
├── Objective 2
│   ├── Activity 2.1
│   ├── Activity 2.2
│   └── Expected Outcome 2
└── Objective 3
    ├── Activity 3.1
    └── Expected Outcome 3
```

**Good Objective:**
```
By September 30, 2027, 80% of participating youth (n=150) will
demonstrate a 20% improvement in math proficiency as measured
by pre/post standardized assessments.
```

**Bad Objective:**
```
Youth will improve their academic performance.
```

## Budget Development

### Federal Budget Categories (SF-424A)

| Category | Description | Common Items |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Personnel | Salaries and wages | Project director, coordinators, specialists |
| Fringe Benefits | Employee benefits | FICA, health insurance, retirement |
| Travel | Project-related travel | Conferences, site visits, mileage |
| Equipment | Items over $5,000 | Specialized equipment only |
| Supplies | Consumable items | Office supplies, curriculum materials |
| Contractual | Subcontracts, consultants | Evaluators, trainers, IT services |
| Construction | Building/renovation | Rare in most grants |
| Other | Miscellaneous costs | Rent, utilities, printing, postage |
| Indirect Costs | Overhead rate | Negotiated IDC rate or de minimis 10% |

### Budget Justification Narrative

Every line item needs justification following this pattern:

```markdown
## Budget Justification: [Category]

### Personnel
**Project Director (1.0 FTE) - $75,000**
The Project Director will oversee all program activities, supervise
staff, manage partner relationships, ensure compliance with grant
requirements, and lead evaluation efforts. Salary is based on the
organization's established pay scale for this position level and
is consistent with Bureau of Labor Statistics median salary for
comparable positions in this region ($72,000-$78,000).

### Fringe Benefits
**Fringe Rate: 28% of Salaries - $21,000**
Fringe benefits include FICA (7.65%), health insurance (14.5%),
retirement contribution (3%), workers' compensation (1.85%), and
unemployment insurance (1%). Rate is based on the organization's
current actual fringe benefit costs as documented in the most
recent audit.

## Writing for Review Criteria

### Aligning Narrative to Rubric

```markdown
## Review Criteria Mapping

| Criterion | Weight | Page Limit | Key Phrases from RFP | Our Response Strategy |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Need | 20 pts | 3 pages | "documented need," "data-driven" | Lead with 5 local data points |
| Design | 30 pts | 5 pages | "evidence-based," "logic model" | Cite 3 research studies |
| Capacity | 20 pts | 3 pages | "qualified staff," "track record" | Highlight 5 years of similar work |
| Evaluation | 15 pts | 2 pages | "measurable outcomes," "data collection" | Include evaluation matrix |
| Budget | 15 pts | 2 pages | "reasonable," "cost-effective" | Benchmark all costs |
```

### Reviewer Psychology

Reviewers are typically:
- Reading multiple proposals in a short time
- Looking for reasons to score high OR low
- Following the rubric systematically
- Noting whether the applicant answered what was asked

### Writing Tips for High Scores

1. **Mirror the language of the RFP** - Use their exact terms
2. **Use headers that match review criteria** - Make it easy to find content
3. **Lead paragraphs with the key point** - Do not bury important information
4. **Quantify everything possible** - Numbers are more convincing than adjectives
5. **One idea per paragraph** - Dense writing loses reviewers
6. **Bold key metrics and outcomes** - Help skimmers find critical data
7. **Address weaknesses proactively** - Acknowledge limitations and mitigations

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Proposal Scope Creep

❌ **Wrong**: Promise everything the funder could possibly want

✅ **Right**: Propose what you can actually deliver with the requested resources, with realistic timelines

### 2. Generic Need Statements

❌ **Wrong**: "Poverty is a national problem affecting millions"

✅ **Right**: "In our service area, 42% of families earn below 200% FPL (ACS 2023), and 68% of surveyed parents report inability to access affordable childcare (Community Survey, 2024, n=312)"

### 3. Unsupported Budget Items

❌ **Wrong**: "Consultant - $50,000"

✅ **Right**: "External Evaluator (Dr. Smith, PhD) - 200 hours at $250/hour = $50,000. Rate based on GSA schedule and comparable evaluator rates in the region. See attached CV and scope of work."

### 4. Ignoring the Rubric

❌ **Wrong**: Write what you think is important

✅ **Right**: Map every section of your narrative to specific review criteria and point values

### 5. Last-Minute Submissions

❌ **Wrong**: Submit at 11:58 PM on the deadline

✅ **Right**: Complete draft 2 weeks before deadline; internal review 1 week before; submit 48 hours early

### 6. Forgetting Post-Award Obligations

❌ **Wrong**: Celebrate the award and figure out implementation later

✅ **Right**: Begin implementation planning during the proposal phase; have systems ready before funds arrive
