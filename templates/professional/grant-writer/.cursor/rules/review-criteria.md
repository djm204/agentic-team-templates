# Writing for Review Criteria

Guidelines for aligning proposals to scoring rubrics and reviewer expectations.

## Aligning Narrative to Rubric

Before writing, create a review criteria mapping:

| Criterion | Weight | Page Limit | Key Phrases from RFP | Response Strategy |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Need | 20 pts | 3 pages | "documented need," "data-driven" | Lead with 5 local data points |
| Design | 30 pts | 5 pages | "evidence-based," "logic model" | Cite 3 research studies |
| Capacity | 20 pts | 3 pages | "qualified staff," "track record" | Highlight 5 years of similar work |
| Evaluation | 15 pts | 2 pages | "measurable outcomes," "data collection" | Include evaluation matrix |
| Budget | 15 pts | 2 pages | "reasonable," "cost-effective" | Benchmark all costs |

## Reviewer Psychology

Reviewers are typically:

- Reading multiple proposals in a short time
- Looking for reasons to score high OR low
- Following the rubric systematically
- Noting whether the applicant answered what was asked

### What Earns High Scores

- Direct answers to what was asked
- Specific, quantified data points
- Clear alignment between need, approach, and outcomes
- Evidence of organizational capacity and track record
- Realistic timelines and budgets
- Acknowledgment of limitations with mitigation strategies

### What Earns Low Scores

- Generic statements without supporting evidence
- Misalignment between sections (need doesn't connect to design)
- Missing required components
- Overpromising relative to resources
- Poor organization that makes information hard to find
- Ignoring the rubric's weighting

## Writing Techniques

### Mirror the Language

Use the exact terms from the RFP. If they say "evidence-based," use "evidence-based" (not "research-backed" or "proven").

### Structure for Scannability

- Use headers that match review criteria labels
- Bold key metrics and outcomes
- Use tables for complex data
- Keep paragraphs focused (one idea each)
- Use bullet lists for multiple items

### Lead with the Answer

Wrong:
```text
Our organization was founded in 1985 and has served the community
for nearly 40 years. Over this time, we have developed numerous
programs... [3 paragraphs later] ...which is why we are qualified
to implement this project.
```

Right:
```text
Our organization has successfully implemented 12 federally-funded
youth development programs serving 3,000+ participants over the
past decade, with an average participant retention rate of 87%.
```

### Quantify Everything

Wrong: "We have significant experience in this area."

Right: "We have managed $4.2M in federal grants over the past 5 years with zero audit findings."

## Letters of Support Strategy

### Effective Letters Include

- Specific commitment (staff time, space, referrals, data, expertise)
- Explanation of why the project matters to the partner
- Concrete role in the project
- Signature from an authorized representative

### Ineffective Letters

- Generic praise without commitments
- Form letters with no specific details
- Letters from organizations with no clear connection to the project

## Pre-Submission Review Checklist

- [ ] Every review criterion is addressed with dedicated content
- [ ] Page limits and formatting requirements met
- [ ] All required attachments included
- [ ] Budget matches narrative (staff, activities, timelines)
- [ ] Logic model aligns with goals, objectives, and evaluation plan
- [ ] All data citations are current (within 3-5 years)
- [ ] DUNS/UEI number and Sam.gov registration current
- [ ] Authorized representative signature obtained
- [ ] Submission system tested (do not wait until deadline)

## Common Pitfalls

### Ignoring the Rubric

Wrong: Write what you think is important.

Right: Map every section of your narrative to specific review criteria and point values.

### Last-Minute Submissions

Wrong: Submit at 11:58 PM on the deadline.

Right: Complete draft 2 weeks before deadline; internal review 1 week before; submit 48 hours early.
