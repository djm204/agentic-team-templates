## Funder Alignment Assessment

Use a scorecard to evaluate fit before investing time in a proposal:

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Mission alignment | | |
| Geographic focus match | | |
| Population served match | | |
| Funding range appropriate | | |
| Eligible applicant type | | |
| Timeline feasibility | | |
| Capacity to meet requirements | | |
| Past relationship with funder | | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 32-40: Strong fit - prioritize
- 24-31: Good fit - pursue if capacity allows
- 16-23: Marginal fit - consider carefully
- Below 16: Poor fit - do not pursue

## Funding Calendar

Maintain a pipeline tracker:

| Opportunity | Funder | Deadline | Amount | Status | Lead |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|------|
| [Grant Name] | [Funder] | [Date] | [Range] | Researching/Writing/Submitted | [Name] |

## Pre-Submission Intelligence

Before writing, gather:

- Previous awardees (who won and what they proposed)
- Funded amounts (typical award sizes)
- Reviewer profiles (who evaluates proposals)
- Program officer contact (relationship building)
- Success rates (how competitive is this opportunity)

## Common Pitfalls

### Chasing Every Opportunity

Wrong: Apply to everything that's remotely related.

Right: Be selective. A focused portfolio of well-aligned proposals beats a scatter-shot approach.

### Ignoring the Funder's History

Wrong: Write a generic proposal without researching the funder.

Right: Study past awards, read the funder's strategic plan, and tailor your approach.
