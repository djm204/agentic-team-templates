# Compliance Requirements

Guidelines for federal and foundation grant compliance, reporting, and record-keeping.

## Federal Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200)

Key compliance areas:

| Area | Requirement | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Financial Management | Adequate accounting systems | Audit reports, policies |
| Procurement | Competitive bidding above thresholds | Procurement records |
| Property Management | Track equipment purchased with funds | Inventory records |
| Time and Effort | Document personnel time on grant | Timesheets, certifications |
| Subrecipient Monitoring | Oversee sub-awards | Monitoring plans, reports |
| Record Retention | Maintain records 3+ years post-closeout | Filing system |

## Human Subjects Research

If the project involves research with human participants:

```text
IRB Decision Tree
├── Is this research? (systematic investigation to develop generalizable knowledge)
│   ├── Yes → IRB review required
│   │   ├── Exempt (minimal risk, standard educational practices)
│   │   ├── Expedited (minimal risk, specific categories)
│   │   └── Full Board (greater than minimal risk)
│   └── No → Program evaluation only
│       └── Document determination
```

## Reporting Requirements

| Report Type | Frequency | Typical Content |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Progress/Performance Report | Quarterly or Semi-Annual | Activities, outputs, outcomes, challenges |
| Financial Report (SF-425) | Quarterly or Semi-Annual | Expenditures by category, match documentation |
| Annual Report | Yearly | Comprehensive progress, data analysis |
| Final Report | End of grant | Cumulative results, lessons learned, sustainability |

## Financial Tracking

```text
Monthly Financial Review
├── Budget vs. Actual comparison by category
├── Burn rate analysis (spending pace)
├── Projection to end of period
├── Identify underspending or overspending
├── Document budget modification needs
└── Reconcile with institutional accounting
```

## Allowable vs. Unallowable Costs

### Generally Allowable

- Salaries and wages for grant-funded staff
- Fringe benefits at documented rates
- Project-specific travel at federal per diem rates
- Supplies directly used for the project
- Subcontracts with proper procurement

### Generally Unallowable

- Entertainment and social events
- Alcoholic beverages
- Fundraising costs
- Lobbying activities
- Fines and penalties
- Bad debts
- Contributions to contingency reserves

## Audit Preparedness

Maintain these records at all times:

- Grant award documents and amendments
- Approved budget and all modifications
- Time and effort certifications for all personnel
- Procurement documentation (solicitations, bids, contracts)
- Financial transaction records with receipts
- Progress reports submitted to funder
- Subrecipient monitoring documentation
- Equipment inventory records

## Common Pitfalls

### Forgetting Post-Award Obligations

Wrong: Celebrate the award and figure out implementation later.

Right: Begin implementation planning during the proposal phase. Have systems ready before funds arrive.

### Commingling Funds

Wrong: Use grant funds for general operations without proper allocation.

Right: Maintain separate accounting codes and track every expenditure to specific grant activities.
