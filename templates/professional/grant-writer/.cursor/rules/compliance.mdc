# Compliance Requirements

Guidelines for federal and foundation grant compliance, reporting, and record-keeping.

## Federal Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200)

| Area | Requirement | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Financial Management | Adequate accounting systems | Audit reports, policies |
| Procurement | Competitive bidding above thresholds | Procurement records |
| Property Management | Track equipment purchased with funds | Inventory records |
| Time and Effort | Document personnel time on grant | Timesheets, certifications |
| Subrecipient Monitoring | Oversee sub-awards | Monitoring plans, reports |
| Record Retention | Maintain records 3+ years post-closeout | Filing system |

## Reporting Requirements

| Report Type | Frequency | Content |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Progress/Performance | Quarterly or Semi-Annual | Activities, outputs, outcomes, challenges |
| Financial (SF-425) | Quarterly or Semi-Annual | Expenditures by category, match docs |
| Annual | Yearly | Comprehensive progress, data analysis |
| Final | End of grant | Cumulative results, lessons learned, sustainability |

## Allowable vs. Unallowable Costs

**Generally allowable:** Salaries/wages for grant staff, fringe at documented rates, project travel at federal per diem, project-specific supplies, properly procured subcontracts.

**Generally unallowable:** Entertainment/social events, alcohol, fundraising, lobbying, fines/penalties, bad debts, contingency reserves.

## Human Subjects Research

If research involves human participants, determine IRB level: Exempt (minimal risk), Expedited (minimal risk, specific categories), or Full Board (greater than minimal risk). Program evaluation only requires documented determination.

## Audit Preparedness

Maintain at all times: award documents and amendments, approved budget and modifications, time/effort certifications, procurement documentation, financial transaction records, progress reports, subrecipient monitoring docs, equipment inventory.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Forgetting post-award obligations** — Begin implementation planning during proposal phase; have systems ready before funds arrive
- **Commingling funds** — Maintain separate accounting codes; track every expenditure to specific grant activities
