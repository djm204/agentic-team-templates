# Proposal Narrative

Guidelines for writing compelling, evidence-based grant narratives.

## Narrative Sections (Typical Weight)

- **Statement of Need** (15-20%): Data-driven case for why the project matters
- **Goals and Objectives** (10-15%): SMART objectives with measurable outcomes
- **Methods / Project Design** (25-30%): Evidence-based approach and activities
- **Evaluation Plan** (15-20%): How outcomes will be measured
- **Organizational Capacity** (10-15%): Qualifications and track record
- **Sustainability Plan** (5-10%): Long-term viability beyond grant funding

## Statement of Need

Structure: geographic/demographic context (cite census, surveys, reports), problem documentation (3-5 recent data points, compare to benchmarks), gap analysis (existing services vs. unmet need), connection to project.

**Good:** "In Westfield County, 34% of children ages 0-5 live below 200% FPL (ACS 2023) vs. 22% statewide. Only 2 centers serve 120 children, leaving 450 without access (County Assessment, 2024)."

**Bad:** "Many children in our area need help. There aren't enough programs."

## Goals and Objectives

Goal (broad) → SMART Objectives → Activities → Expected Outcomes.

**Good:** "By Sept 30, 2027, 80% of participants (n=150) will demonstrate 20% improvement in math proficiency via pre/post standardized assessments."

**Bad:** "Youth will improve their academic performance."

## Logic Model

Map: Inputs (resources needed) → Activities (what you do) → Outputs (evidence of work) → Short-term Outcomes (changes in people) → Long-term Outcomes (lasting community impact).

## Theory of Change

**If-Then Chain:** If we [invest resources] and [implement activities], then [outputs], leading to [short-term outcomes], contributing to [long-term outcomes], because [evidence base].

Include: assumptions that must hold, evidence citations supporting the approach, clear causal pathway between each stage.

## Writing Tips

1. Mirror the RFP's exact language
2. Use headers matching review criteria
3. Lead paragraphs with the key point
4. Quantify everything possible
5. One idea per paragraph
6. Bold key metrics and outcomes
7. Address weaknesses proactively

## Anti-Patterns

- **Scope creep** — Propose what you can deliver with requested resources and realistic timelines
- **Generic need statements** — Cite local data, compare to benchmarks, quantify the specific gap
