# Sustainability Planning

Guidelines for demonstrating long-term program viability beyond grant funding.

## Sustainability Framework

- **Financial:** Diversified funding (no single source > 40%), earned revenue strategies, endowment/reserve building, continued grant seeking
- **Programmatic:** Embed in organizational operations, build staff capacity beyond grant-funded positions, create replicable processes, document best practices
- **Community:** Build local ownership, train community members, create advisory structures, establish partnerships
- **Political:** Engage policymakers, document outcomes for advocacy, build coalition support, align with policy priorities

## Narrative Components

Address these questions in the sustainability section:

**Financial:** How will activities continue after funding ends? What alternative sources are identified? What revenue-generating activities are planned?

**Organizational:** How will program knowledge be retained if grant-funded staff leave? What systems outlast the grant? How does this integrate with existing strategy?

**Community:** How are community members involved in design and governance? What local capacity is being built? What partnerships continue beyond the grant?

## Phased Sustainability Plan

- **Year 1 (Grant-Funded):** Establish program, build partnerships, collect outcome data. 100% grant-funded.
- **Year 2 (Transition):** Demonstrate outcomes, diversify funding. Target: 60% grant, 20% organizational, 20% new sources.
- **Year 3+ (Self-Sustaining):** Integrate into operations. Target: 30% grants, 40% organizational, 30% earned/other.

Include a funding diversification table: source, amount, status (identified/applied/confirmed), timeline.

## Credibility Markers

Reviewers look for evidence sustainability is realistic, not aspirational:
- Diversified revenue already in place
- Board commitment (resolution supporting long-term program)
- Partner MOUs with written commitments
- Track record of sustaining previously grant-funded programs
- Earned revenue model (fee-for-service, social enterprise, membership)
- Alignment with existing policy mandates

## Anti-Patterns

- **Vague promises** — "We will seek additional funding" vs. naming 3 specific sources with projected amounts and application timelines
- **Afterthought sustainability** — Build sustainability into program design from day one; it's a design constraint, not an appendix
