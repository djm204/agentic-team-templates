# Budget Development

Guidelines for creating defensible grant budgets with clear justification narratives.

## Federal Budget Categories (SF-424A)

| Category | Description | Common Items |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Personnel | Salaries and wages | Project director, coordinators, specialists |
| Fringe Benefits | Employee benefits | FICA, health insurance, retirement |
| Travel | Project-related travel | Conferences, site visits, mileage |
| Equipment | Items over $5,000 | Specialized equipment only |
| Supplies | Consumable items | Office supplies, curriculum materials |
| Contractual | Subcontracts, consultants | Evaluators, trainers, IT services |
| Other | Miscellaneous costs | Rent, utilities, printing, postage |
| Indirect Costs | Overhead rate | Negotiated IDC rate or de minimis 10% |

## Budget Justification Pattern

Every line item needs: **what** (role/item), **how much** (calculation showing rate x quantity), **why** (how it serves the project), and **basis** (source for rate/cost, e.g., BLS median, GSA schedule, organizational pay scale).

## Cost Share / Match

- **Cash match:** Source, amount, status (committed/pending), documentation (board resolution, MOU)
- **In-Kind match:** Source, description, valuation method (Independent Sector rate, fair market appraisal), amount

## Budget Modification Rules

| Modification | Threshold | Approval |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Line item reallocation | < 10% of total | Usually internal |
| Line item reallocation | > 10% of total | Prior funder approval |
| Scope change | Any | Prior approval required |
| No-cost extension | N/A | Written request ~90 days before end |
| Key personnel change | Any | Prior approval required |

## Quality Checks Before Submission

- All math correct (totals, percentages, multi-year calculations)
- Fringe rate matches organizational documentation
- Travel costs align with federal per diem rates
- Consultant rates justified and reasonable
- IDC rate matches negotiated agreement or uses de minimis 10%
- Match meets minimum requirements
- Budget aligns with narrative (every described activity has corresponding costs)

## Anti-Patterns

- **Unsupported items** — "Consultant - $50,000" vs. "200 hours x $250/hr, rate per GSA schedule, see CV"
- **Budget-narrative mismatch** — Every position, activity, and deliverable in narrative needs a budget line
