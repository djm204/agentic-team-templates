Guidelines for demonstrating long-term program viability beyond grant funding.

## Sustainability Framework

```text
Sustainability Strategy

│   ├── Create replicable processes
│   └── Document and share best practices
├── Community Sustainability
│   ├── Build local ownership
│   ├── Train community members
│   ├── Create advisory structures

└── Political Sustainability
    ├── Engage policymakers
    ├── Document outcomes for advocacy
    ├── Build coalition support
    └── Align with policy priorities

## Sustainability Narrative Components

When writing a sustainability section for a proposal, address these questions:

### Financial Sustainability

- How will activities continue after grant funding ends?
- What alternative funding sources have been identified?
- What revenue-generating activities are planned?
- How will the organization build this into its operating budget?

### Organizational Sustainability

- How will program knowledge be retained if grant-funded staff leave?
- What systems and processes will outlast the grant period?
- How does this initiative integrate with existing organizational strategy?

### Community Sustainability

- How are community members involved in program design and governance?
- What local capacity is being built?
- What partnerships will continue beyond the grant?

## Sustainability Plan Template

```markdown
## Sustainability Plan: [Program Name]

### Year 1 (Grant-Funded)
- Focus: Establish program, build partnerships, collect outcome data
- Funding: 100% grant-funded
- Key milestones: [List]

### Year 2 (Transition)
- Focus: Demonstrate outcomes, diversify funding
- Funding: 60% grant, 20% organizational, 20% new sources
- Key milestones: [List]

### Year 3+ (Self-Sustaining)
- Focus: Integrate into organizational operations
- Funding: 30% grants, 40% organizational, 30% earned/other
- Key milestones: [List]

### Funding Diversification Strategy
| Source | Amount | Status | Timeline |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| [Source 1] | $X | [Identified/Applied/Confirmed] | [Date] |
| [Source 2] | $X | [Identified/Applied/Confirmed] | [Date] |

### Organizational Integration
[How the program will become part of regular operations]

### Community Ownership
[How community members will sustain and govern the program]
```

## Credibility Markers

Reviewers look for evidence that sustainability is realistic, not aspirational:

- **Diversified revenue**: Multiple funding sources already in place
- **Board commitment**: Board resolution supporting long-term program
- **Partner MOUs**: Written commitments from collaborating organizations
- **Track record**: History of sustaining previously grant-funded programs
- **Earned revenue**: Fee-for-service, social enterprise, or membership models
- **Policy alignment**: Program aligns with existing policy mandates

## Common Pitfalls

### Vague Promises

Wrong: "We will seek additional funding to sustain the program."

Right: "We have identified three specific funding sources (X, Y, Z) totaling $150K annually and will submit applications in Year 2. Additionally, our fee-for-service model is projected to generate $45K annually by Year 3 based on comparable program data."

### Ignoring Sustainability Until the End

Wrong: Write the sustainability section as an afterthought.

Right: Build sustainability thinking into program design from the beginning. Sustainability is a design constraint, not an appendix.
