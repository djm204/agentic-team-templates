# Budget Development

Guidelines for creating defensible grant budgets with clear justification narratives.

## Federal Budget Categories (SF-424A)

| Category | Description | Common Items |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Personnel | Salaries and wages | Project director, coordinators, specialists |
| Fringe Benefits | Employee benefits | FICA, health insurance, retirement |
| Travel | Project-related travel | Conferences, site visits, mileage |
| Equipment | Items over $5,000 | Specialized equipment only |
| Supplies | Consumable items | Office supplies, curriculum materials |
| Contractual | Subcontracts, consultants | Evaluators, trainers, IT services |
| Construction | Building/renovation | Rare in most grants |
| Other | Miscellaneous costs | Rent, utilities, printing, postage |
| Indirect Costs | Overhead rate | Negotiated IDC rate or de minimis 10% |

## Budget Justification Narrative

Every line item needs justification following this pattern:

```markdown
### Personnel
**Project Director (1.0 FTE) - $75,000**
The Project Director will oversee all program activities, supervise
staff, manage partner relationships, ensure compliance with grant
requirements, and lead evaluation efforts. Salary is based on the
organization's established pay scale for this position level and
is consistent with Bureau of Labor Statistics median salary for
comparable positions in this region ($72,000-$78,000).

### Fringe Benefits
**Fringe Rate: 28% of Salaries - $21,000**
Fringe benefits include FICA (7.65%), health insurance (14.5%),
retirement contribution (3%), workers' compensation (1.85%), and
unemployment insurance (1%). Rate is based on the organization's
current actual fringe benefit costs as documented in the most
recent audit.
```

## Multi-Year Budget Template

| Line Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Personnel | $X | $X (+3% COLA) | $X (+3% COLA) | $X |
| Fringe | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| Travel | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| Supplies | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| Contractual | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| Other | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| **Direct Costs** | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** |
| Indirect (10%) | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| **Total** | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** |

## Cost Share / Match Requirements

### Cash Match

| Source | Amount | Status | Documentation |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Organization general funds | $X | Committed | Board resolution |
| Partner contribution | $X | Committed | MOU |

### In-Kind Match

| Source | Description | Valuation Method | Amount |
|--------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Volunteer hours | 500 hrs x $29.95/hr | Independent Sector rate | $14,975 |
| Donated space | 2,000 sq ft x $12/sq ft | Fair market value appraisal | $24,000 |

## Budget Modification Rules

| Modification Type | Threshold | Approval Required |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Line item reallocation | < 10% of total | Usually internal |
| Line item reallocation | > 10% of total | Prior approval from funder |
| Scope change | Any | Prior approval required |
| No-cost extension | N/A | Written request, usually 90 days before end |
| Key personnel change | Any | Prior approval required |

## Budget Quality Checks

Before submission, verify:

- All math is correct (totals, percentages, multi-year calculations)
- Fringe rate matches organizational documentation
- Travel costs align with federal per diem rates
- Consultant rates are justified and reasonable
- Indirect cost rate matches negotiated agreement or uses de minimis 10%
- Match/cost share meets minimum requirements
- Budget aligns with narrative (activities described have corresponding costs)

## Common Pitfalls

### Unsupported Budget Items

Wrong: "Consultant - $50,000"

Right: "External Evaluator (Dr. Smith, PhD) - 200 hours at $250/hour = $50,000. Rate based on GSA schedule and comparable evaluator rates in the region. See attached CV and scope of work."

### Budget-Narrative Mismatch

Wrong: Narrative describes five staff positions; budget shows three.

Right: Every position, activity, and deliverable in the narrative has a corresponding budget line item.
