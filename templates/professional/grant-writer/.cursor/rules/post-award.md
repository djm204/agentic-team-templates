# Post-Award Management

Guidelines for grant implementation, financial oversight, and reporting.

## Award Setup Checklist

- [ ] Review Notice of Award terms and conditions
- [ ] Set up grant-specific accounting codes
- [ ] Establish time and effort reporting
- [ ] Create project timeline with milestones
- [ ] Onboard or reassign staff
- [ ] Notify partners and subrecipients
- [ ] Set up data collection systems
- [ ] Schedule reporting deadlines in calendar
- [ ] Conduct kickoff meeting

## Financial Oversight

### Monthly Review Process

1. **Budget vs. Actual**: Compare spending to plan by category
2. **Burn Rate**: Calculate spending pace relative to grant period
3. **Projections**: Forecast spending through end of period
4. **Variances**: Identify and document over/under spending
5. **Modifications**: Determine if budget changes are needed
6. **Reconciliation**: Match internal records to institutional accounting

### Warning Signs

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Spending < 50% at midpoint | Underspending risk | Accelerate activities or request no-cost extension |
| Spending > 75% at midpoint | Overspending risk | Review and adjust budget allocations |
| Key position vacant > 60 days | Activity delays | Expedite hiring or request scope adjustment |
| Subrecipient behind schedule | Downstream delays | Increase monitoring, provide technical assistance |

## No-Cost Extension Request

```markdown

```

## Data Collection and Evaluation

### Implementation Tracking

- Record all activities as they occur (do not reconstruct later)
- Track outputs quantitatively (number served, hours delivered, events held)
- Collect outcome data at planned intervals (pre/post assessments)
- Document challenges and adaptations
- Maintain participant records with appropriate consent

### Evaluation Timeline

| Phase | Activity | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Baseline | Collect pre-intervention data | Before activities begin |
| Process | Monitor implementation fidelity | Ongoing |
| Formative | Assess early outcomes, adjust | Midpoint |
| Summative | Measure final outcomes | End of grant period |

## Grant Closeout

### Closeout Checklist

- [ ] All grant-funded activities completed
- [ ] Final progress report submitted
- [ ] Final financial report (SF-425) submitted
- [ ] All equipment inventoried and disposition determined
- [ ] Subrecipient closeout completed
- [ ] Records organized for retention period (minimum 3 years)
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Final reconciliation with institutional accounting
- [ ] Excess funds returned (if applicable)

## Common Pitfalls

### Reactive Reporting

Wrong: Scramble to compile data when reports are due.

Right: Collect data continuously. Reporting should be a matter of formatting what you already have.

### Ignoring Burn Rate

Wrong: Realize at month 10 that 60% of funds are unspent.

Right: Review spending monthly. Identify pace issues early and adjust.
