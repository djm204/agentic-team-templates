# Writing for Review Criteria

Guidelines for aligning proposals to scoring rubrics and reviewer expectations.

## Review Criteria Mapping

Before writing, map every criterion: weight (points), page limit, key phrases from RFP, and your response strategy.

Example: Need (20 pts, 3 pages, "documented need" / "data-driven") → Lead with 5 local data points.

## Reviewer Psychology

Reviewers are reading multiple proposals quickly, following the rubric systematically, and looking for reasons to score high or low.

**High scores:** Direct answers to what was asked, specific quantified data, clear alignment between need/approach/outcomes, evidence of capacity, realistic timelines and budgets, acknowledged limitations with mitigations.

**Low scores:** Generic unsupported statements, section misalignment, missing required components, overpromising relative to resources, poor organization, ignoring rubric weighting.

## Writing Techniques

- **Mirror the language** — Use exact terms from the RFP ("evidence-based" not "research-backed")
- **Structure for scannability** — Headers matching criteria labels, bold key metrics, tables for data, one idea per paragraph
- **Lead with the answer** — "We have managed $4.2M in federal grants with zero audit findings" not 3 paragraphs of history first
- **Quantify everything** — "Significant experience" → "$4.2M in federal grants over 5 years"

## Letters of Support

**Effective:** Specific commitments (staff time, space, referrals, data), explanation of why project matters to partner, concrete role, authorized signature.

**Ineffective:** Generic praise without commitments, form letters, letters from unrelated organizations.

## Pre-Submission Checklist

- Every review criterion addressed with dedicated content
- Page limits and formatting requirements met
- All required attachments included
- Budget matches narrative
- Logic model aligns with goals, objectives, and evaluation
- Data citations current (within 3-5 years)
- Registration current (DUNS/UEI, Sam.gov)
- Submission system tested before deadline

## Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring the rubric** — Map every narrative section to specific criteria and point values
- **Last-minute submissions** — Draft 2 weeks early, internal review 1 week early, submit 48 hours before deadline
