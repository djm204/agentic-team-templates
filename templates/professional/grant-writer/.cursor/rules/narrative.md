## Statement of Need

The need statement establishes why the project matters. It must be data-driven and specific.

### Structure

1. **Geographic and Demographic Context**: Define service area with specificity using census data, surveys, or agency reports
2. **Problem Documentation**: Present 3-5 data points that quantify the problem using recent data (within 3-5 years)
3. **Gap Analysis**: What services exist, where do they fall short, what is unmet?
4. **Connection to Project**: How does this project address the documented gaps?

### Good Need Statement

```text
In Westfield County, 34% of children ages 0-5 live in households
below 200% of the federal poverty level (ACS 2023), compared to
22% statewide. Despite this elevated need, the county has only
two licensed childcare centers serving 120 children, leaving an
estimated 450 children without access to quality early education
(County Needs Assessment, 2024). Families report average wait
times of 14 months for childcare placement (Parent Survey, n=187).
```

### Bad Need Statement

```text
Many children in our area need help. There aren't enough programs
to serve them. We believe our program will make a difference.
```

## Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes

```text
Goal (Broad, aspirational)
├── Objective 1 (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
│   ├── Activity 1.1
│   ├── Activity 1.2
│   └── Expected Outcome 1
├── Objective 2
│   ├── Activity 2.1
│   ├── Activity 2.2
│   └── Expected Outcome 2
```

### Good Objective

```text
By September 30, 2027, 80% of participating youth (n=150) will
demonstrate a 20% improvement in math proficiency as measured
by pre/post standardized assessments.
```

### Bad Objective

```text
Youth will improve their academic performance.
```

## Logic Model

## Theory of Change

### If-Then Chain

If we [invest these resources] and [implement these activities], then we will produce [these outputs], which will lead to [these short-term outcomes], which will contribute to [these long-term outcomes], because [underlying assumptions/evidence base].

### Required Components

- **Assumptions**: What must be true for the theory to hold
- **Evidence Base**: Research citations supporting the approach
- **Causal Pathway**: Clear logical connections between each stage

## Writing Tips for High Scores

1. **Mirror the language of the RFP** - Use their exact terms
2. **Use headers that match review criteria** - Make it easy to find content
3. **Lead paragraphs with the key point** - Do not bury important information
4. **Quantify everything possible** - Numbers are more convincing than adjectives
5. **One idea per paragraph** - Dense writing loses reviewers
6. **Bold key metrics and outcomes** - Help skimmers find critical data
7. **Address weaknesses proactively** - Acknowledge limitations and mitigations

## Common Pitfalls

### Proposal Scope Creep

Wrong: Promise everything the funder could possibly want.

Right: Propose what you can actually deliver with the requested resources, with realistic timelines.

### Generic Need Statements

Wrong: "Poverty is a national problem affecting millions."

Right: Cite local data, compare to benchmarks, quantify the specific gap your project addresses.
