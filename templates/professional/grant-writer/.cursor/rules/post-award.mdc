# Post-Award Management

Guidelines for grant implementation, financial oversight, and reporting.

## Award Setup Checklist

- Review Notice of Award terms and conditions
- Set up grant-specific accounting codes
- Establish time and effort reporting
- Create project timeline with milestones
- Onboard or reassign staff
- Notify partners and subrecipients
- Set up data collection systems
- Schedule reporting deadlines
- Conduct kickoff meeting

## Financial Oversight

**Monthly review:** Budget vs. actual by category, burn rate analysis, projections to end of period, variance identification, modification needs, reconciliation with institutional accounting.

| Warning Signal | Meaning | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Spending < 50% at midpoint | Underspending risk | Accelerate activities or request no-cost extension |
| Spending > 75% at midpoint | Overspending risk | Review and adjust allocations |
| Key position vacant > 60 days | Activity delays | Expedite hiring or request scope adjustment |
| Subrecipient behind schedule | Downstream delays | Increase monitoring, provide technical assistance |

## Data Collection and Evaluation

- Record activities as they occur (do not reconstruct later)
- Track outputs quantitatively (number served, hours delivered, events held)
- Collect outcome data at planned intervals (pre/post assessments)
- Document challenges and adaptations
- Phases: Baseline → Process monitoring → Formative (midpoint) → Summative (end)

## No-Cost Extension

Submit request (usually 90 days before end) with: grant number, current/requested end dates, justification, remaining funds and spending plan, activities to complete, impact on project goals.

## Grant Closeout Checklist

- All grant-funded activities completed
- Final progress and financial reports submitted
- Equipment inventoried and disposition determined
- Subrecipient closeout completed
- Records organized for retention (minimum 3 years)
- Lessons learned documented
- Final reconciliation complete
- Excess funds returned if applicable

## Anti-Patterns

- **Reactive reporting** — Collect data continuously; reporting should be formatting what you already have
- **Ignoring burn rate** — Review spending monthly; identify pace issues early
