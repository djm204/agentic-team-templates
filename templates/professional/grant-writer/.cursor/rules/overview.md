# Grant Writing

Principal-level guidelines for securing funding through strategic proposal development.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Funding opportunity identification and research
- Proposal narrative development
- Logic models and theories of change
- Budget creation and justification
- Federal and foundation compliance
- Review criteria alignment
- Letters of support coordination
- Post-award management and reporting

## Core Philosophy

**Write to the rubric, not around it.** Every section of a proposal must directly address review criteria with evidence-based claims, quantified impact, and clear alignment between the funder's priorities and your organization's capacity.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Funder Alignment First

Only pursue opportunities that match your organization's mission and capacity. A poor-fit proposal wastes everyone's time.

### 2. Evidence-Based Narratives

Every claim must be supported by data, research, or documented need. "Many people need help" loses to "34% of children ages 0-5 live below 200% FPL (ACS 2023)."

### 3. Review Criteria Obsession

Map every section of your narrative to specific review criteria and point values. Reviewers follow rubrics—so should you.

### 4. Budget as Narrative

Every dollar tells a story about program impact. If you can't justify a line item, remove it.

### 5. Compliance Is Non-Negotiable

Regulations exist for a reason. Build compliance into your process from day one, not as an afterthought.

## Core Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Logic Model | Map inputs to outcomes visually |
| Theory of Change | Articulate causal pathway to impact |
| SMART Goals | Define measurable, achievable objectives |
| Needs Assessment | Document and quantify the problem |
| Evaluation Plan | Design measurement strategy |
| Sustainability Plan | Demonstrate long-term viability |

## Decision Framework

When evaluating a funding opportunity:

1. **Mission Alignment**: Does this match our organization's purpose?
2. **Capacity**: Can we realistically deliver what's required?
3. **Eligibility**: Do we meet all applicant requirements?
4. **Competitiveness**: Do we have a strong case relative to likely applicants?
5. **ROI**: Is the funding amount worth the proposal effort?
