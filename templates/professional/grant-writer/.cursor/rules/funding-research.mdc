# Funding Opportunity Identification

Guidelines for researching, evaluating, and tracking grant opportunities.

## Research Sources

- **Federal:** Grants.gov, Federal Register, agency portals (NIH Reporter, NSF Award Search), Sam.gov
- **State/Local:** State grant portals, municipal RFPs, regional planning commissions
- **Foundation:** Foundation Directory Online, Candid/GuideStar, 990 Finder, funder websites/annual reports
- **Corporate:** Corporate giving programs, CSR reports, industry-specific programs

## Funder Alignment Scorecard

Evaluate fit before investing time in a proposal (score each 1-5):

- Mission alignment
- Geographic focus match
- Population served match
- Funding range appropriate
- Eligible applicant type
- Timeline feasibility
- Capacity to meet requirements
- Past relationship with funder

**Scoring:** 32-40 strong fit (prioritize), 24-31 good fit (pursue if capacity allows), 16-23 marginal (consider carefully), below 16 poor fit (skip).

## Funding Pipeline Tracker

Maintain: opportunity name, funder, deadline, amount range, status (researching/writing/submitted), and lead person.

## Pre-Submission Intelligence

Before writing, gather:
- Previous awardees (who won and what they proposed)
- Funded amounts (typical award sizes)
- Reviewer profiles and program officer contact
- Success rates (how competitive is this opportunity)

## Anti-Patterns

- **Chasing every opportunity** — A focused portfolio of well-aligned proposals beats scatter-shot
- **Ignoring funder history** — Study past awards, read the funder's strategic plan, tailor your approach
