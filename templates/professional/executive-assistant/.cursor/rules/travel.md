## Booking Standards

### Flights

- Book 2-3 weeks in advance for domestic, 4-6 weeks for international
- Prefer direct flights; connections add risk
- Morning flights for same-day meetings
- Maintain loyalty program consistency

### Hotels

- Proximity to meeting locations is priority one
- Consistent chain for loyalty points accumulation
- Late check-out requests when departure is afternoon
- Confirm WiFi quality for remote work needs

### Ground Transportation

- Pre-book car services for airport transfers
- Rideshare as backup; never sole plan for critical timing
- Rental cars only when multiple site visits required
- Account for traffic patterns at destination

## Expense Tracking

| Category | Documentation Required | Policy Limit |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Airfare | Boarding pass + receipt | Per company travel policy |
| Hotel | Folio with itemized charges | Nightly rate cap per city |
| Meals | Itemized receipt + attendees | Per diem or per-meal cap |
| Ground Transport | Receipt + route | Reasonable/actual |
| Incidentals | Receipt | Daily cap |

## Contingency Planning

### Flight Disruption

- Alternative flight options pre-researched (next 2 flights)
- Airline status number saved for priority rebooking
- Video conference backup for critical meetings
- Hotel extension option confirmed

### Health/Safety

- Travel insurance details accessible
- Nearest hospital/urgent care identified
- Pharmacy locations noted
- Emergency contacts list (local + home office)

### Technology

- Chargers and adapters packed
- Mobile hotspot available
- Critical documents accessible offline
- VPN configured for hotel WiFi

## Common Pitfalls

### No Contingency Plan

Wrong: Book one flight, one hotel, assume everything works.

Right: Pre-research alternative flights, confirm flexible hotel booking, have video conference backup for critical meetings.

### Missing Details

Wrong: Itinerary says "Meeting at 3 PM."

Right: Itinerary includes address, contact person, phone number, purpose, and travel time from previous location.
