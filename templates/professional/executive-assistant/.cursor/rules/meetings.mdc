# Meeting Preparation

Guidelines for meeting briefs, agendas, minutes, and action item tracking.

## Pre-Meeting Brief Template

Include: date/time/timezone, location/link, duration, attendees (name, role, key context), purpose (one sentence), agenda (topic, duration, owner), background points, executive's objectives, sensitive topics, materials list, prep actions.

## Agenda Best Practices

| Element | Standard | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Time allocation | Assign minutes per topic | "Budget review (15 min)" |
| Topic owners | Name who leads each section | "Q3 Pipeline - Sarah" |
| Outcome type | Specify: Decision, Discussion, FYI | "[DECISION] Vendor selection" |
| Pre-read | List materials to review beforehand | "See attached P&L summary" |
| Parking lot | Reserve 5 min for overflow items | "Parking lot (5 min)" |

## Meeting Minutes Template

Include: date, attendees/absent, key decisions (with context and rationale), action items table (action, owner, due date, status), discussion summary per topic, parking lot items, next meeting date and focus.

## Meeting Lifecycle

1. **24 hours before** — Send brief with agenda and materials
2. **15 minutes before** — Confirm room/link, check AV
3. **During** — Take notes, track decisions and action items
4. **Within 4 hours after** — Send minutes and action items
5. **At next occurrence** — Follow up on open action items

## Anti-Patterns

- **No agenda** — Every meeting needs written agenda with time allocations, topic owners, and expected outcomes
- **Untracked action items** — Every action item needs an owner, due date, and tracking mechanism
