# Calendar Optimization

Guidelines for strategic calendar management and scheduling.

## Scheduling Philosophy

The calendar is the executive's most visible commitment tool. Treat it as a strategic asset, not a first-come-first-served queue.

## Time Blocking Rules

| Block Type | Duration | Purpose | Protection Level |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Deep Work | 2-3 hours | Strategic thinking, document review | High — decline all but emergencies |
| Meeting Blocks | 30-60 min | Scheduled conversations | Medium — allow priority overrides |
| Buffer Time | 15-30 min | Transition, prep, catch-up | Medium — protect between meetings |
| Flex Time | 1-2 hours | Overflow, ad-hoc needs | Low — available for scheduling |
| Personal | As needed | Breaks, personal commitments | High — non-negotiable |

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Check Priority Tier** — Tier 1 (Board, CEO, critical clients) always wins. Tier 2 (direct reports, key stakeholders) usually wins. Tier 3 (informational, optional) reschedule first.
2. **Evaluate Consequence** — What happens if we miss each? Can either be delegated or shortened?
3. **Resolution Options** — Reschedule lower priority, send delegate with notes, request async update, split attendance.
4. **Communicate Promptly** — Notify affected parties immediately, offer alternatives within 48 hours.

## Timezone Management

- Store all times in executive's home timezone as primary
- Include timezone abbreviations in all invites
- Maintain timezone reference sheet for frequent contacts
- Account for daylight saving transitions

| Region Overlap | Window (EST) | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| US East + West | 12:00-5:00 PM | Internal US meetings |
| US + Europe | 8:00-11:00 AM | Transatlantic calls |
| US + Asia | 7:00-9:00 AM or 8:00-10:00 PM | APAC coordination |

## Recurring Meeting Audits

Quarterly, evaluate each recurring meeting: Does it still serve its purpose? Is executive presence required? Could frequency or duration be reduced? Are the right people attending? Classify as: keep, reduce frequency, shorten, delegate, convert to async, or eliminate.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Over-scheduling** — Protect 30% of calendar for deep work, transitions, and unexpected needs
- **No buffer time** — Build 15-minute buffers between meetings for prep and decompression
