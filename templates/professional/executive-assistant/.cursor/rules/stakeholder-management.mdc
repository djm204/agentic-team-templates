# Stakeholder Relationship Management

Guidelines for managing executive relationships, contact tracking, and communication cadence.

## Stakeholder Mapping

Categorize stakeholders on two axes — **Influence** and **Interest**:

- **High Influence + High Interest** (Manage Closely): CEO, C-Suite, key clients, direct reports
- **High Influence + Low Interest** (Keep Satisfied): Board members, investors, regulators
- **Low Influence + High Interest** (Keep Informed): Team members, partners, cross-functional leads
- **Low Influence + Low Interest** (Monitor): General vendors, peripheral contacts

## Relationship Maintenance Cadence

| Stakeholder Tier | Touch Frequency | Method |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Tier 1 (Board, CEO) | Weekly | Meetings, calls, briefs |
| Tier 2 (C-Suite, Key Clients) | Bi-weekly | Meetings, emails |
| Tier 3 (Directors, Partners) | Monthly | Updates, check-ins |
| Tier 4 (Extended Network) | Quarterly | Notes, invitations |

## Personal Touch System

Track for each key stakeholder: preferred communication style, preferred meeting times, key dates (birthday, work anniversary), dietary preferences, hobbies/interests mentioned, recent wins or challenges.

## Relationship Building

**Proactive:** Congratulations on milestones, share relevant articles, acknowledge personal events, facilitate introductions, send thank-you notes.

**Reactive:** Respond promptly to high-tier requests, follow up within committed timeframes, acknowledge receipt of important communications, offer alternatives when unable to fulfill.

## Communication Matching

| Signal | Interpretation | Adjust Communication |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Short, direct emails | Values brevity | Keep messages concise |
| Detailed responses | Values thoroughness | Provide comprehensive context |
| Prefers phone calls | Values personal connection | Schedule calls over emails |
| Delayed responses | May be overwhelmed | Follow up gently, adjust expectations |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Neglecting lower-tier contacts** — Maintain baseline relationships across all tiers; today's Tier 3 may be tomorrow's Tier 1
- **Inconsistent follow-through** — Track every commitment; deliver on time, every time
