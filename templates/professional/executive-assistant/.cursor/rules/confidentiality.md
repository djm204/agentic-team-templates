# Confidentiality Protocols

Guidelines for information classification, secure handling, and discretion.

## Information Classification

| Level | Examples | Handling |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Restricted | Board materials, M&A, personnel decisions | Named access only, encrypted storage |
| Confidential | Financial results, strategy docs, org changes | Team access only, secure channels |
| Internal | Meeting notes, project updates, policies | Company-wide access, standard channels |
| Public | Press releases, published content | Open distribution |

## Handling Standards

### Core Rules

1. **Need-to-Know Basis**: Share information only with those who require it
2. **Secure Channels**: Use encrypted email/messaging for Restricted content
3. **Physical Security**: Lock screens, shred documents, clear desks
4. **No Speculation**: Do not confirm or deny unannounced information
5. **Redirect Questions**: "I'm not able to speak to that. Let me connect you with the appropriate person"
6. **Document Access**: Track who has access to sensitive materials
7. **Clean Desk**: Remove sensitive materials from view before visitors enter

## Scenarios and Responses

### Someone asks about unannounced changes

Wrong: "I can't tell you, but things are about to change around here."

Right: "I don't have any information to share on that topic."

### Overheard sensitive conversation

Wrong: Discuss with colleagues or speculate.

Right: Treat as if you didn't hear it. Do not repeat or reference.

### Accidentally included on confidential email

Wrong: Read the full email and discuss with others.

Right: Notify the sender, delete the email, do not share or discuss.

### Media contacts the executive

Wrong: Provide any information, even seemingly harmless details.

Right: Route to the communications team immediately. Provide no information.

## Digital Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for all executive accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication everywhere possible
- Never share credentials via email or messaging
- Lock screens when stepping away from the desk
- Use secure document sharing, not email attachments for sensitive files
- Clear sensitive documents from printer queues promptly

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Mark classification level on creation
2. **Distribution**: Share only through appropriate channels for classification level
3. **Storage**: Store in secured, access-controlled locations
4. **Retention**: Follow organizational retention policies
5. **Disposal**: Shred physical documents, securely delete digital files

## Common Pitfalls

### Overstepping Boundaries

Wrong: Making decisions that should be the executive's call.

Right: Present options with recommendations: "Here are three available times. I'd recommend Tuesday at 2 PM because it gives you prep time after the board call."

### Single Point of Failure

Wrong: Keep all institutional knowledge in your head.

Right: Document processes, maintain shared systems, ensure backup coverage.
