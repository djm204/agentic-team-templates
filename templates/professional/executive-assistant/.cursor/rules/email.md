# Email Management

Guidelines for email triage, drafting, and follow-up tracking.

## Triage Framework

```text
Incoming Email
├── Urgent + Important → Respond within 2 hours
│   └── Flag for executive or draft immediate response
├── Important + Not Urgent → Respond within 24 hours
│   └── Queue for daily email review block
├── Urgent + Not Important → Delegate or template response
│   └── Handle directly or forward to appropriate person
└── Not Urgent + Not Important → Batch process
    └── Archive, unsubscribe, or schedule for weekly review
```

## Email Drafting Standards

### Structure

Every email follows this pattern:

1. **Subject Line**: `[Action Tag] Topic - Context`
   - Tags: `[ACTION REQUIRED]` `[FYI]` `[DECISION NEEDED]` `[RESPONSE REQUESTED]`
2. **Opening**: One sentence stating the purpose
3. **Context**: 2-3 sentences of relevant background
4. **Ask/Information**: The specific request or update
5. **Next Steps**: Clear actions with owners and deadlines
6. **Closing**: Appropriate sign-off matching relationship level

### Examples

Good subject: `[DECISION NEEDED] Q3 Budget Allocation - Finance Review by Friday`

Bad subject: `Quick question`

## Tone Calibration

| Recipient | Tone | Formality | Example Opening |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Board Members | Respectful, concise | High | "Dear [Name], I'm writing to..." |
| C-Suite Peers | Professional, direct | Medium-High | "Hi [Name], following up on..." |
| Direct Reports | Warm, clear | Medium | "Hi [Name], quick note on..." |
| External Partners | Professional, courteous | High | "Dear [Name], thank you for..." |
| Vendors | Businesslike, firm | Medium | "Hi [Name], regarding our..." |

## Follow-Up Tracking

### Categories

- **Awaiting Response**: Sent, expecting reply by date
- **Awaiting Action**: Delegated, checking on date
- **Pending Decision**: Executive needs to decide by date
- **Scheduled Send**: Draft ready, send on date/time

### Escalation Timeline

- Day 1: Initial send
- Day 3: Gentle follow-up if no response
- Day 7: Second follow-up with urgency note
- Day 10: Escalate to executive or alternative contact

## Common Pitfalls

### Assuming Context

Wrong: Forward a request without background.

Right: Provide full context: "John from Acme is asking about the Q3 renewal. Background: we discussed extending their contract at Tuesday's meeting. He wants to confirm pricing by Friday."

### Over-CCing

Wrong: CC everyone who might be tangentially interested.

Right: CC only those who need awareness. Use BCC for large distribution lists.
