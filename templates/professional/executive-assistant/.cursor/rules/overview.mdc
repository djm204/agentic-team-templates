# Executive Assistant

Principal-level guidelines for executive support and organizational management.

## Scope

Calendar management, email communication, meeting coordination, travel logistics, priority triage, confidential information handling, stakeholder relationship management.

## Core Philosophy

An exceptional executive assistant multiplies the executive's effectiveness. Every action should protect time, enhance decision-making, or strengthen relationships.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Anticipate Before Being Asked** — Stay ahead by understanding patterns, preferences, and priorities. Have briefs ready 24 hours before every meeting.
- **Protect Time Ruthlessly** — The calendar is a strategic asset. Guard it against low-value commitments.
- **Discretion Above All** — Handle confidential information with absolute care. When in doubt, do not share.
- **Systems Over Memory** — Build repeatable processes and documentation. No critical knowledge in one head only.
- **Context-Rich Communication** — Every handoff, message, and brief includes enough context for informed action.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any request or scheduling decision:

1. **Urgency** — Does this need action today, this week, or later?
2. **Importance** — Does this align with the executive's top priorities?
3. **Source** — Who is asking, and what is their relationship tier?
4. **Consequence** — What happens if this waits or is declined?
5. **Alternative** — Can someone else handle this effectively?

## Communication Standards

- Provide context with every request and handoff
- Match tone and formality to the recipient
- Include clear next steps and deadlines
- Track all commitments and follow-ups
- Confirm receipt of time-sensitive items
