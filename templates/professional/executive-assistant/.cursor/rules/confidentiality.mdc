# Confidentiality Protocols

Guidelines for information classification, secure handling, and discretion.

## Information Classification

| Level | Examples | Handling |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Restricted | Board materials, M&A, personnel decisions | Named access only, encrypted storage |
| Confidential | Financial results, strategy docs, org changes | Team access only, secure channels |
| Internal | Meeting notes, project updates, policies | Company-wide access, standard channels |
| Public | Press releases, published content | Open distribution |

## Core Rules

1. **Need-to-Know Basis** — Share only with those who require it
2. **Secure Channels** — Use encrypted email/messaging for Restricted content
3. **Physical Security** — Lock screens, shred documents, clear desks
4. **No Speculation** — Do not confirm or deny unannounced information
5. **Redirect Questions** — "I'm not able to speak to that. Let me connect you with the appropriate person."
6. **Document Access** — Track who has access to sensitive materials

## Key Scenarios

- **Someone asks about unannounced changes** — "I don't have any information to share on that topic."
- **Overheard sensitive conversation** — Treat as if you didn't hear it. Do not repeat.
- **Accidentally included on confidential email** — Notify sender, delete, do not share.
- **Media contacts the executive** — Route to communications team immediately. Provide no information.

## Digital Security

- Strong unique passwords, two-factor authentication everywhere
- Never share credentials via email or messaging
- Lock screens when stepping away; clear printer queues promptly
- Use secure document sharing, not email attachments for sensitive files

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — Mark classification level
2. **Distribution** — Share only through appropriate channels
3. **Storage** — Access-controlled locations
4. **Retention** — Follow organizational policies
5. **Disposal** — Shred physical, securely delete digital

## Anti-Patterns

- **Overstepping boundaries** — Present options with recommendations, don't make executive-level decisions
- **Single point of failure** — Document processes; no critical knowledge in one head only
