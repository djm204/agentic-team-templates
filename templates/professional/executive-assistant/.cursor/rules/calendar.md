# Calendar Optimization

Guidelines for strategic calendar management and scheduling.

## Scheduling Philosophy

The calendar is the executive's most visible commitment tool. Treat it as a strategic asset, not a first-come-first-served queue.

## Weekly Calendar Structure

```text
Weekly Calendar Structure
├── Monday: Strategy & Planning
│   ├── Morning: Weekly priority review
│   ├── Midday: Leadership team sync
│   └── Afternoon: 1:1s with direct reports
├── Tuesday-Wednesday: External Meetings
│   ├── Client meetings
│   ├── Partner calls
│   └── Board prep (as needed)
├── Thursday: Deep Work & Internal
│   ├── Morning: Focus block (no meetings)
│   ├── Afternoon: Cross-functional syncs
│   └── Late: Catch-up meetings
└── Friday: Review & Prep
    ├── Morning: Week review
    ├── Midday: Next week prep
    └── Afternoon: Flex time
```

## Time Blocking Rules

| Block Type | Duration | Purpose | Protection Level |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Deep Work | 2-3 hours | Strategic thinking, document review | High - decline all but emergencies |
| Meeting Blocks | 30-60 min | Scheduled conversations | Medium - allow priority overrides |
| Buffer Time | 15-30 min | Transition, prep, catch-up | Medium - protect between meetings |
| Flex Time | 1-2 hours | Overflow, ad-hoc needs | Low - available for scheduling |
| Personal | As needed | Breaks, personal commitments | High - non-negotiable |

## Conflict Resolution

When two meetings conflict:

1. **Check Priority Tier**
   - Tier 1: Board, CEO, critical clients - always wins
   - Tier 2: Direct reports, key stakeholders - usually wins
   - Tier 3: Informational, optional - reschedule first

2. **Evaluate Consequence**
   - What happens if we miss each meeting?
   - Can either be delegated?
   - Can either be shortened?

3. **Resolution Options**
   - Reschedule the lower-priority meeting
   - Send a delegate with briefing notes
   - Request async update instead of live meeting
   - Split attendance (join for critical portion only)

4. **Communicate Promptly**
   - Notify affected parties immediately
   - Offer alternative times within 48 hours
   - Provide context without over-explaining

## Timezone Management

### Standard Practices

- Store all times in the executive's home timezone as primary
- Include timezone abbreviations in all invites: "3:00 PM EST / 12:00 PM PST"
- Maintain a timezone reference sheet for frequent contacts
- Account for daylight saving transitions (update twice yearly)

### Scheduling Windows

| Region Overlap | Window (EST) | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| US East + West | 12:00-5:00 PM | Internal US meetings |
| US + Europe | 8:00-11:00 AM | Transatlantic calls |
| US + Asia | 7:00-9:00 AM or 8:00-10:00 PM | APAC coordination |
| Europe + Asia | 6:00-8:00 AM EST (their afternoon) | Delegate if possible |

## Recurring Meeting Audits

Conduct quarterly audits of all recurring meetings:

### Evaluation Criteria

- Does this meeting still serve its original purpose?
- Is the executive's presence required, or can they delegate?
- Could the frequency be reduced?
- Could the duration be shortened?
- Are the right people attending?
- Is there a clear agenda and outcome?

### Recommendations

After evaluation, classify each meeting as:

- Keep as-is
- Reduce frequency
- Shorten duration
- Delegate attendance
- Convert to async update
- Eliminate

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Scheduling

Wrong: Fill every open slot with meetings.

Right: Protect 30% of the calendar for deep work, transitions, and unexpected needs.

### No Buffer Time

Wrong: Schedule back-to-back meetings with zero transition time.

Right: Build in 15-minute buffers between meetings for prep and decompression.
