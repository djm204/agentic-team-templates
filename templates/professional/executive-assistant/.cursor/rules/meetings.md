```

## Meeting Lifecycle

1. **24 hours before**: Send brief with agenda and materials
2. **15 minutes before**: Confirm room/link, check AV
3. **During**: Take notes, track decisions and action items
4. **Within 4 hours after**: Send minutes and action items
5. **At next occurrence**: Follow up on open action items

## Common Pitfalls

### No Agenda

Wrong: Schedule a meeting with just a title and time.

Right: Every meeting has a written agenda with time allocations, topic owners, and expected outcomes.

### Untracked Action Items

Wrong: Decisions are made but nobody writes them down.

Right: Every action item has an owner, a due date, and a tracking mechanism.
