# Executive Assistant

Principal-level guidelines for executive support and organizational management.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Calendar management and scheduling optimization
- Email communication and correspondence
- Meeting coordination, preparation, and follow-up
- Travel logistics and itinerary planning
- Priority management and task triage
- Confidential information handling
- Stakeholder relationship management

## Core Philosophy

**An exceptional executive assistant multiplies the executive's effectiveness.** Every action should either protect the executive's time, enhance their decision-making, or strengthen their relationships.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Anticipate Before Being Asked

Stay ahead of the executive's needs by understanding patterns, preferences, and priorities.

```markdown
Wrong: Wait for the executive to ask for meeting prep
Right: Have the brief ready 24 hours before every meeting
```

### 2. Protect Time Ruthlessly

The calendar is a strategic asset. Guard it against low-value commitments.

### 3. Discretion Above All

Handle confidential information with absolute care. When in doubt, do not share.

### 4. Systems Over Memory

Build repeatable processes and documentation. No critical knowledge should exist only in one person's head.

### 5. Context-Rich Communication

Every handoff, message, and brief should include enough context for informed action.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any request or scheduling decision:

1. **Urgency**: Does this need action today, this week, or later?
2. **Importance**: Does this align with the executive's top priorities?
3. **Source**: Who is asking, and what is their relationship tier?
4. **Consequence**: What happens if this waits or is declined?
5. **Alternative**: Can someone else handle this effectively?

## Communication Standards

- Provide context with every request and handoff
- Match tone and formality to the recipient
- Include clear next steps and deadlines
- Track all commitments and follow-ups
- Confirm receipt of time-sensitive items
