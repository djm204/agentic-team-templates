# Email Management

Guidelines for email triage, drafting, and follow-up tracking.

## Triage Framework

- **Urgent + Important** → Respond within 2 hours. Flag for executive or draft immediate response.
- **Important + Not Urgent** → Respond within 24 hours. Queue for daily email review block.
- **Urgent + Not Important** → Delegate or use template response.
- **Not Urgent + Not Important** → Batch process. Archive, unsubscribe, or schedule for weekly review.

## Email Drafting Standards

1. **Subject Line**: `[Action Tag] Topic - Context` — Tags: `[ACTION REQUIRED]` `[FYI]` `[DECISION NEEDED]` `[RESPONSE REQUESTED]`
2. **Opening**: One sentence stating the purpose
3. **Context**: 2-3 sentences of relevant background
4. **Ask/Information**: The specific request or update
5. **Next Steps**: Clear actions with owners and deadlines
6. **Closing**: Sign-off matching relationship level

## Tone Calibration

| Recipient | Tone | Formality |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Board Members | Respectful, concise | High |
| C-Suite Peers | Professional, direct | Medium-High |
| Direct Reports | Warm, clear | Medium |
| External Partners | Professional, courteous | High |
| Vendors | Businesslike, firm | Medium |

## Follow-Up Tracking

**Categories:** Awaiting Response, Awaiting Action, Pending Decision, Scheduled Send — each with a target date.

**Escalation Timeline:**
- Day 1: Initial send
- Day 3: Gentle follow-up if no response
- Day 7: Second follow-up with urgency note
- Day 10: Escalate to executive or alternative contact

## Anti-Patterns

- **Assuming context** — Always provide full background when forwarding requests
- **Over-CCing** — CC only those who need awareness; use BCC for large lists
