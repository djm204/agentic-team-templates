# Travel Coordination

Guidelines for booking, itinerary creation, expense tracking, and contingency planning.

## Itinerary Essentials

Every itinerary includes: quick reference (confirmation numbers, emergency/local contacts, timezone, weather), day-by-day schedule (time, activity, details with addresses and confirmations), logistics summary (flights, hotel, ground, dining), and documents checklist (passport/ID, boarding passes, confirmations, meeting materials, expense folder).

## Booking Standards

**Flights:** Book 2-3 weeks ahead (domestic), 4-6 weeks (international). Prefer direct flights. Morning flights for same-day meetings. Maintain loyalty program consistency.

**Hotels:** Proximity to meetings is priority one. Consistent chain for loyalty. Late check-out when departure is afternoon. Confirm WiFi for remote work.

**Ground:** Pre-book car services for airport transfers. Rideshare as backup only, never sole plan for critical timing. Rental cars only for multiple site visits. Account for traffic patterns.

## Expense Tracking

| Category | Documentation Required | Policy Limit |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Airfare | Boarding pass + receipt | Per travel policy |
| Hotel | Folio with itemized charges | Nightly rate cap per city |
| Meals | Itemized receipt + attendees | Per diem or per-meal cap |
| Ground Transport | Receipt + route | Reasonable/actual |
| Incidentals | Receipt | Daily cap |

## Contingency Planning

**Flight disruption:** Pre-research alternative flights, save airline status number, have video conference backup, confirm hotel extension option.

**Health/Safety:** Travel insurance details accessible, nearest hospital identified, pharmacy locations noted, emergency contacts list ready.

**Technology:** Chargers and adapters packed, mobile hotspot available, critical documents offline, VPN configured.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No contingency plan** — Always pre-research alternatives and have video backup for critical meetings
- **Missing details** — Include address, contact person, phone, purpose, and travel time for every event
