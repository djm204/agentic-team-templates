## Relationship Maintenance Cadence

| Stakeholder Tier | Touch Frequency | Method |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Tier 1 (Board, CEO) | Weekly | Meetings, calls, briefs |
| Tier 2 (C-Suite, Key Clients) | Bi-weekly | Meetings, emails |
| Tier 3 (Directors, Partners) | Monthly | Updates, check-ins |
| Tier 4 (Extended Network) | Quarterly | Notes, invitations |

## Personal Touch System

Track for each key stakeholder:

- Preferred communication style (email, phone, in-person)
- Preferred meeting times
- Key dates (birthday, work anniversary)
- Family details they have shared
- Dietary preferences/restrictions
- Hobbies and interests mentioned
- Recent wins or challenges

## Relationship Building Actions

### Proactive Touches

- Send congratulations on professional milestones
- Share relevant articles or industry news
- Remember and acknowledge personal events
- Facilitate introductions when mutually beneficial
- Send thank-you notes after significant interactions

### Reactive Touches

- Respond promptly to requests from high-tier stakeholders
- Provide follow-up within committed timeframes
- Acknowledge receipt of important communications
- Offer alternatives when unable to fulfill a request

## Communication Matching

### Reading the Relationship

| Signal | Interpretation | Adjust Communication |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Short, direct emails | Values brevity | Keep messages concise |
| Detailed responses | Values thoroughness | Provide comprehensive context |
| Prefers phone calls | Values personal connection | Schedule calls over emails |
| Delayed responses | May be overwhelmed or low priority | Follow up gently, adjust expectations |

## Common Pitfalls

### Neglecting Lower-Tier Contacts

Wrong: Focus exclusively on Tier 1 stakeholders.

Right: Maintain baseline relationships across all tiers. Today's Tier 3 contact may be tomorrow's Tier 1.

### Inconsistent Follow-Through

Wrong: Promise to send information and forget.

Right: Track every commitment in your follow-up system. Deliver on time, every time.
