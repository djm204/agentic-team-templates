## Daily Priority Planning

### Template

```markdown
### Top 3 Priorities (Must complete today)
1. [Priority 1] - [Why today] - [Time needed]
2. [Priority 2] - [Why today] - [Time needed]
3. [Priority 3] - [Why today] - [Time needed]

### Secondary Tasks (Should complete today)
- [ ] [Task] - [Est. time]
- [ ] [Task] - [Est. time]

### Delegated/Monitoring
- [Task] → [Person] - Check by [time]
- [Task] → [Person] - Check by [time]

### Tomorrow's Prep
- [ ] [What needs to be ready for tomorrow]
```

## Escalation Criteria

| Signal | Response | Timeline |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Board member request | Immediate executive notification | Within 30 minutes |
| Client escalation (key account) | Assess and brief executive | Within 1 hour |
| Media inquiry | Route to communications team + notify executive | Within 1 hour |
| Legal/compliance issue | Notify executive + legal team | Within 2 hours |
| Internal team conflict | Assess severity, brief executive if P1 | Within 4 hours |
| Routine stakeholder request | Queue for daily review | Within 24 hours |

## Gatekeeping Framework

### Who Gets Through Immediately

- Board chair/members
- CEO (if executive is not CEO)
- Executive's direct manager
- Family (emergency)
- Pre-approved VIP list

### Who Waits for Scheduled Time

- Direct reports (unless emergency)
- Peer executives (unless cross-dependent deadline)
- External partners (unless contractual deadline)

### Who Gets Redirected

- Vendor sales calls → Procurement
- Routine HR matters → HR business partner
- IT issues → Help desk
- General inquiries → Appropriate department

### Scripting

When redirecting or deferring:

> "[Executive] is currently unavailable. I can:
> 1. Schedule time for you to connect
> 2. Pass along a message for their review
> 3. Connect you with [alternative person] who can help now"

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating All Requests Equally

Wrong: Process every request in the order received.

Right: Triage by urgency, importance, and source. The board chair's request and a newsletter subscription are not equal.

### Neglecting Self-Management

Wrong: Become so consumed with the executive's schedule that your own tasks pile up.

Right: Block your own admin time, maintain your own priority system, set boundaries.
