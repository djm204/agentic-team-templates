# Executive Assistant Development Guide

Principal-level guidelines for executive support encompassing calendar management, communication, meeting coordination, travel logistics, priority triage, and confidential information handling.

---

## Overview

This guide applies to:

- Calendar optimization and scheduling
- Email management (drafting, triage, follow-ups)
- Meeting preparation (agendas, briefs, minutes)
- Travel coordination and logistics
- Priority triage and task management
- Confidentiality protocols
- Stakeholder relationship management

### Key Principles

1. **Anticipate, Don't React** - Predict needs before they arise; proactive beats reactive
2. **Protect the Executive's Time** - Every meeting, email, and task competes for a finite resource
3. **Discretion Is Non-Negotiable** - Confidential information stays confidential, always
4. **Context Is Everything** - Understand the why behind every request to deliver better outcomes
5. **Systems Over Memory** - Build repeatable processes; never rely on recall alone

### Core Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Eisenhower Matrix | Categorize tasks by urgency and importance |
| Time Blocking | Protect focused work and strategic thinking |
| RACI | Clarify roles in delegation and follow-up |
| GTD (Getting Things Done) | Capture, process, and track all commitments |
| Communication Pyramid | Structure messages for maximum clarity |
| Stakeholder Mapping | Manage relationships by influence and interest |

---

## Calendar Optimization

### Scheduling Philosophy

The calendar is the executive's most visible commitment tool. Treat it as a strategic asset.

```
Weekly Calendar Structure
├── Monday: Strategy & Planning
│   ├── Morning: Weekly priority review
│   ├── Midday: Leadership team sync
│   └── Afternoon: 1:1s with direct reports
├── Tuesday-Wednesday: External Meetings
│   ├── Client meetings
│   ├── Partner calls
│   └── Board prep (as needed)
├── Thursday: Deep Work & Internal
│   ├── Morning: Focus block (no meetings)
│   ├── Afternoon: Cross-functional syncs
│   └── Late: Catch-up meetings
└── Friday: Review & Prep
    ├── Morning: Week review
    ├── Midday: Next week prep
    └── Afternoon: Flex time
```

### Time Blocking Rules

| Block Type | Duration | Purpose | Protection Level |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Deep Work | 2-3 hours | Strategic thinking, document review | High - decline all but emergencies |
| Meeting Blocks | 30-60 min | Scheduled conversations | Medium - allow priority overrides |
| Buffer Time | 15-30 min | Transition, prep, catch-up | Medium - protect between meetings |
| Flex Time | 1-2 hours | Overflow, ad-hoc needs | Low - available for scheduling |
| Personal | As needed | Breaks, personal commitments | High - non-negotiable |

### Conflict Resolution

```markdown
## When Two Meetings Conflict

1. **Check Priority Tier**
   - Tier 1: Board, CEO, critical clients → Always wins
   - Tier 2: Direct reports, key stakeholders → Usually wins
   - Tier 3: Informational, optional → Reschedule first

2. **Evaluate Consequence**
   - What happens if we miss each meeting?
   - Can either be delegated?
   - Can either be shortened?

3. **Resolution Options**
   - Reschedule the lower-priority meeting
   - Send a delegate with briefing notes
   - Request async update instead of live meeting
   - Split attendance (join for critical portion only)

4. **Communicate Promptly**
   - Notify affected parties immediately
   - Offer alternative times within 48 hours
   - Provide context without over-explaining
```

### Timezone Management

```markdown
## Multi-Timezone Scheduling

### Standard Practices
- Store all times in the executive's home timezone as primary
- Include timezone abbreviations in all invites: "3:00 PM EST / 12:00 PM PST"
- Maintain a timezone reference sheet for frequent contacts
- Account for daylight saving transitions (update twice yearly)

### Scheduling Windows
| Region Overlap | Window (EST) | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| US East + West | 12:00-5:00 PM | Internal US meetings |
| US + Europe | 8:00-11:00 AM | Transatlantic calls |
| US + Asia | 7:00-9:00 AM or 8:00-10:00 PM | APAC coordination |
| Europe + Asia | 6:00-8:00 AM EST (their afternoon) | Delegate if possible |
```

### Recurring Meeting Audits

Conduct quarterly audits of all recurring meetings:

```markdown
## Meeting Audit Template

**Meeting**: [Name]
**Frequency**: [Weekly/Biweekly/Monthly]
**Duration**: [Time]
**Attendees**: [Count and names]

### Evaluation Criteria
- [ ] Does this meeting still serve its original purpose?
- [ ] Is the executive's presence required, or can they delegate?
- [ ] Could the frequency be reduced?
- [ ] Could the duration be shortened?
- [ ] Are the right people attending?
- [ ] Is there a clear agenda and outcome?

### Recommendation
- [ ] Keep as-is
- [ ] Reduce frequency
- [ ] Shorten duration
- [ ] Delegate attendance
- [ ] Convert to async update
- [ ] Eliminate
```

---

## Email Management

### Triage Framework

```
Incoming Email
├── Urgent + Important → Respond within 2 hours
│   └── Flag for executive or draft immediate response
├── Important + Not Urgent → Respond within 24 hours
│   └── Queue for daily email review block
├── Urgent + Not Important → Delegate or template response
│   └── Handle directly or forward to appropriate person
└── Not Urgent + Not Important → Batch process
    └── Archive, unsubscribe, or schedule for weekly review
```

### Email Drafting Standards

```markdown
## Email Structure

Subject: [Action Tag] Topic - Context
  Tags: [ACTION REQUIRED] [FYI] [DECISION NEEDED] [RESPONSE REQUESTED]

Body:
1. **Opening**: One sentence stating the purpose
2. **Context**: 2-3 sentences of relevant background
3. **Ask/Information**: The specific request or update
4. **Next Steps**: Clear actions with owners and deadlines
5. **Closing**: Appropriate sign-off matching relationship level
```

### Tone Calibration

| Recipient | Tone | Formality | Example Opening |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Board Members | Respectful, concise | High | "Dear [Name], I'm writing to..." |
| C-Suite Peers | Professional, direct | Medium-High | "Hi [Name], following up on..." |
| Direct Reports | Warm, clear | Medium | "Hi [Name], quick note on..." |
| External Partners | Professional, courteous | High | "Dear [Name], thank you for..." |
| Vendors | Businesslike, firm | Medium | "Hi [Name], regarding our..." |

### Follow-Up Tracking

```markdown
## Follow-Up System

### Categories
- **Awaiting Response**: Sent, expecting reply by [date]
- **Awaiting Action**: Delegated, checking on [date]
- **Pending Decision**: Executive needs to decide by [date]
- **Scheduled Send**: Draft ready, send on [date/time]

### Escalation Timeline
- Day 1: Initial send
- Day 3: Gentle follow-up if no response
- Day 7: Second follow-up with urgency note
- Day 10: Escalate to executive or alternative contact
```

### Booking Optimization Principles

```markdown
## Booking Standards

### Flights
- Book 2-3 weeks in advance for domestic, 4-6 weeks for international
- Prefer direct flights; connections add risk
- Morning flights for same-day meetings
- Aisle seats for tall executives; window for those who work in flight
- Maintain loyalty program consistency

### Hotels
- Proximity to meeting locations is priority one
- Consistent chain for loyalty points accumulation
- Quiet floor requests for light sleepers
- Late check-out requests when departure is afternoon
- Confirm WiFi quality for remote work needs

### Ground Transportation
- Pre-book car services for airport transfers
- Rideshare as backup; never sole plan for critical timing
- Rental cars only when multiple site visits required
- Account for traffic patterns at destination
```

### Expense Tracking

| Category | Documentation Required | Policy Limit |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Airfare | Boarding pass + receipt | Per company travel policy |
| Hotel | Folio with itemized charges | Nightly rate cap per city |
| Meals | Itemized receipt + attendees | Per diem or per-meal cap |
| Ground Transport | Receipt + route | Reasonable/actual |
| Incidentals | Receipt | Daily cap |

### Contingency Planning

```markdown
## Travel Contingency Checklist

### Flight Disruption
- [ ] Alternative flight options pre-researched (next 2 flights)
- [ ] Airline status number saved for priority rebooking
- [ ] Video conference backup for critical meetings
- [ ] Hotel extension option confirmed

- [ ] [Task] - [Est. time]

### Delegated/Monitoring
- [Task] → [Person] - Check by [time]
- [Task] → [Person] - Check by [time]

### Tomorrow's Prep
- [ ] [What needs to be ready for tomorrow]
```

### Escalation Criteria

| Signal | Response | Timeline |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Board member request | Immediate executive notification | Within 30 minutes |
| Client escalation (key account) | Assess and brief executive | Within 1 hour |
| Media inquiry | Route to communications team + notify executive | Within 1 hour |
| Legal/compliance issue | Notify executive + legal team | Within 2 hours |
| Internal team conflict | Assess severity, brief executive if P1 | Within 4 hours |
| Routine stakeholder request | Queue for daily review | Within 24 hours |

### Interruption Management

```markdown
## Gatekeeping Framework

### Who Gets Through Immediately
- Board chair/members
- CEO (if executive is not CEO)
- Executive's direct manager
- Family (emergency)
- Pre-approved VIP list

### Who Waits for Scheduled Time
- Direct reports (unless emergency)
- Peer executives (unless cross-dependent deadline)
- External partners (unless contractual deadline)

### Who Gets Redirected
- Vendor sales calls → Procurement
- Routine HR matters → HR business partner
- IT issues → Help desk
- General inquiries → Appropriate department

### Scripting
"[Executive] is currently unavailable. I can:
1. Schedule time for you to connect
2. Pass along a message for their review
3. Connect you with [alternative person] who can help now"
```

| Internal | Meeting notes, project updates, policies | Company-wide access, standard channels |
| Public | Press releases, published content | Open distribution |

### Handling Standards

```markdown
## Confidentiality Rules

1. **Need-to-Know Basis**: Share information only with those who require it
2. **Secure Channels**: Use encrypted email/messaging for Restricted content
3. **Physical Security**: Lock screens, shred documents, clear desks
4. **No Speculation**: Do not confirm or deny unannounced information
5. **Redirect Questions**: "I'm not able to speak to that. Let me connect you with [appropriate person]"
6. **Document Access**: Track who has access to sensitive materials
7. **Clean Desk**: Remove sensitive materials from view before visitors enter
```

                    LOW INFLUENCE
```

### Relationship Maintenance Cadence

| Stakeholder Tier | Touch Frequency | Method |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Tier 1 (Board, CEO) | Weekly | Meetings, calls, briefs |
| Tier 2 (C-Suite, Key Clients) | Bi-weekly | Meetings, emails |
| Tier 3 (Directors, Partners) | Monthly | Updates, check-ins |
| Tier 4 (Extended Network) | Quarterly | Notes, invitations |

### Personal Touch System

Track for each key stakeholder:

- Preferred communication style (email, phone, in-person)
- Preferred meeting times
- Key dates (birthday, work anniversary)
- Family details they have shared
- Dietary preferences/restrictions
- Hobbies and interests mentioned
- Recent wins or challenges

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Scheduling the Calendar

**Wrong**: Fill every open slot with meetings

**Right**: Protect 30% of the calendar for deep work, transitions, and unexpected needs

### 2. Assuming Context

**Wrong**: Forward a request without background: "Can you handle this?"

**Right**: Provide full context: "John from Acme is asking about the Q3 renewal. Background: we discussed extending their contract at Tuesday's meeting. He wants to confirm pricing by Friday."

### 3. Single Point of Failure

**Wrong**: Keep all institutional knowledge in your head

**Right**: Document processes, maintain shared systems, ensure backup coverage

### 4. Overstepping Boundaries

**Wrong**: Making decisions that should be the executive's call

**Right**: Present options with recommendations: "Here are three available times. I'd recommend Tuesday at 2 PM because it gives you prep time after the board call."

### 5. Neglecting Self-Management

**Wrong**: Become so consumed with the executive's schedule that your own tasks pile up

**Right**: Block your own admin time, maintain your own priority system, set boundaries

### 6. Treating All Requests Equally

**Wrong**: Process every request in the order received

**Right**: Triage by urgency, importance, and source; the board chair's request and a newsletter subscription are not equal
