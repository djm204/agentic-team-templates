# Nutrition Planning

Guidelines for caloric targeting, macronutrient distribution, meal timing, and sustainable dietary design.

## Principles

- **Calories determine weight direction** — No macro ratio or food choice overrides energy balance
- **Protein is the priority macro** — 1.4-2.4 g/kg supports muscle retention, satiety, recovery
- **Sustainability over perfection** — 80% consistent adherence beats 40% on an "optimal" plan
- **Food quality beyond macros** — Whole, minimally processed foods provide fiber, micronutrients, phytochemicals
- **No morality in food** — Frame as goal alignment, never "good" or "bad" eating

## Caloric Targets

1. Estimate BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor equation)
2. Apply activity multiplier (TDEE = BMR x 1.2-1.9, be conservative)
3. Goal adjustment: fat loss -300 to -500 kcal, maintenance ±100, gain +200 to +400
4. Monitor 7-day weight average every 2 weeks; adjust by 100-200 kcal increments
5. Plan diet breaks: 1-2 weeks at maintenance every 8-12 weeks of deficit

## Macros by Goal

| Goal | Protein (g/kg) | Carbs | Fat |
|------|---------------|-------|-----|
| Fat loss | 1.8-2.4 | 30-40% | 25-35% |
| Maintenance | 1.4-2.0 | 40-55% | 25-35% |
| Muscle gain | 1.6-2.2 | 45-60% | 20-30% |
| Endurance | 1.4-1.8 | 50-65% | 20-30% |

## Meal Timing

- **Pre-workout (1-3h):** Moderate carbs, moderate protein, low fat/fiber
- **Post-workout (within 2h):** 20-40g protein, carbs for glycogen
- **Pre-sleep:** Casein/cottage cheese; avoid large meals within 2h of bed
- **General:** Spread protein across 3-5 meals (20-40g each)
- **Caffeine cutoff:** 8-10 hours before bed

## Supplement Priorities

- **Tier 1 (common gaps):** Vitamin D (1000-4000 IU), Omega-3 (1-3g EPA+DHA), Magnesium
- **Tier 2 (conditional):** Creatine (3-5g daily), Iron (with confirmed deficiency), B12 (vegan/vegetarian)
- **Tier 3 (situational):** Protein powder, electrolytes during heavy exercise

## Hydration

Baseline: 30-40 ml/kg daily. During exercise >60 min: 500-1000 ml/hr with electrolytes. Post-exercise: 1.5x fluid lost.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Extreme deficits** — >500 kcal risks muscle loss, metabolic adaptation, rebound
- **Tracking without understanding** — Prioritize whole foods 80%; tracking identifies patterns, not justifies poor choices
- **Eliminating food groups without cause** — Only with confirmed medical reason or structured elimination protocol
