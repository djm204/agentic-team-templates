# Adaptive Planning

Guidelines for cross-domain optimization, goal balancing, plan adjustment triggers, and maintaining a unified wellness plan.

## Principles

- **Plans are hypotheses, not contracts** — Update as the person's body, life, and goals change
- **Adjust one variable at a time** — Change one parameter, observe 1-2 weeks before changing another
- **Lead indicators over lag** — Readiness, mood, adherence predict outcomes; weight and performance confirm them
- **Sustainability beats optimization** — 6 months of consistent adherence beats 3 weeks of aggressive effort
- **Regression is information** — Declining metrics are signals to investigate, not push harder

## Cross-Domain Interactions

| Domains | Key Interaction | Management |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Fitness ↔ Nutrition | Training volume drives caloric need; deficit impairs recovery | Align calories with training phase |
| Fitness ↔ Sleep | Late-evening exercise disrupts sleep; poor sleep reduces readiness | Complete vigorous training 3-4h before bed |
| Fitness ↔ Mental | Exercise boosts mood; overtraining causes mood decline | Monitor mood alongside training load |
| Nutrition ↔ Sleep | Caffeine and large late meals disrupt sleep; alcohol suppresses REM | Enforce caffeine cutoff; meals 2-3h before bed |
| Nutrition ↔ Mental | Severe deficit increases irritability; gut health affects mood | Ease deficit if mood drops below 4/10 for 3+ days |
| Sleep ↔ Mental | Sleep deprivation amplifies reactivity; anxiety drives insomnia | Prioritize sleep when stress is high |

## Plan Adjustment Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold | Response |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Weight plateau | No change 3+ weeks | Reassess calories, check adherence, consider diet break |
| Readiness decline | Below 50 for 3+ days | Reduce training, extend sleep, audit stressors |
| Mood decline | Below 4/10 for 3+ days | Prioritize mental wellness, reduce training |
| Sleep quality drop | Efficiency < 80% for 1+ week | Sleep hygiene audit, check caffeine/alcohol/anxiety |
| Persistent soreness | > 72 hours | Deload, add recovery, rule out injury |
| Life disruption | Travel, illness, crisis | Switch to maintenance across all domains |

## Goal Priority Hierarchy

1. **Health Protection** — Adequate sleep (7+h, 85%+ efficiency), no injury progression, mental wellness above thresholds, normal clinical markers
2. **Recovery Capacity** — Readiness averaging > 60, stress manageable, social connection maintained
3. **Active Goals** — Body composition, performance, habit formation targets
4. **Optimization** — Fine-tuning macros, supplements, advanced periodization

A Tier 3 goal must never compromise Tier 1 or 2. Ease the deficit if it degrades sleep and mood.

## Adherence Tracking

| Level | % | Action |
|-------|---|--------|
| Excellent | 90-100% | Maintain plan |
| Good | 75-89% | Maintain; minor tweaks |
| Fair | 60-74% | Simplify plan, reduce tracked variables |
| Poor | < 60% | Major reassessment — plan design problem, not willpower |

## Phase Transitions

- **Deficit → Maintenance:** 2-4 weeks, increase 100-200 kcal/week
- **Maintenance → Surplus:** 1-2 weeks, increase 200-300 kcal
- **High volume → Deload:** 1 week, volume -40-60%, intensity -20-30%
- **Injury → Return:** Start at 50% pre-injury volume, progress 10-20%/week

## Anti-Patterns

- **Changing too many variables** — Isolate changes to identify what works
- **Ignoring adherence data** — Low adherence is plan feedback, not character failure
- **Review without action** — Every review produces a specific adjustment or explicit hold decision
