# Health Data Integration

Guidelines for aggregating, normalizing, and interpreting wellness data from wearables, self-reports, and clinical sources.

## Integration Principles

- **Normalize before comparing** — Different devices use different algorithms; convert to standardized units and apply consistent smoothing
- **7-day rolling averages over daily snapshots** — Single-day readings fluctuate due to hydration, device fit, alcohol, etc.
- **Subjective data is real data** — Mood, energy, soreness ratings often detect issues before wearable metrics do
- **Source hierarchy** — Clinical lab > wearable trends > consistent self-report patterns > sporadic readings
- **Privacy by default** — Collect only metrics relevant to active goals; store in user-controlled accounts

## Data Source Priority

| Priority | Source | Reliability |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Clinical lab data (blood panels, DEXA) | Very High |
| 2 | Validated self-report scales (PSS-4, PHQ-9) | High |
| 3 | Wearable continuous data (HR, HRV, sleep) | Moderate-High |
| 4 | App-logged training data (sets, reps, load) | Moderate-High |
| 5 | Self-reported mood and energy (1-10) | Moderate |
| 6 | Smart scale estimates (body fat %) | Low-Moderate |
| 7 | Calorie tracking app estimates | Low-Moderate |

## Readiness Score (0-100)

| Component | Weight | Primary Source | Fallback |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| HRV vs personal baseline | 25% | Wearable morning reading | Skip if unavailable |
| Sleep quality composite | 25% | Wearable sleep stages + duration | Self-reported quality |
| Subjective energy and mood | 20% | Morning self-report (1-10) | Always collect |
| Soreness and recovery | 15% | Self-reported soreness map | Days since rest day |
| Stress and life load | 15% | Self-reported stress scale | Calendar density proxy |

When a source is unavailable, redistribute its weight proportionally across remaining components.

## Data Quality Checks

- Verify physiologically plausible ranges (resting HR 35-100 bpm, HRV 5-300 ms)
- Check for sync gaps > 24 hours that skew averages
- Flag sudden jumps (device change, firmware, wearing error)
- Cross-reference wearable vs. subjective when they significantly diverge
- Discard clearly erroneous readings rather than averaging them in

## Cross-Device Normalization

- **Different HRV algorithms** — Convert to common unit; track relative change to personal baseline, not absolutes
- **Sleep stage classification** — Use total sleep time and efficiency as primary; treat stages as approximate
- **Device switch** — Mark date, restart baseline with 14-day adaptation window

## Anti-Patterns

- **Trusting single-day readings** — Compare against 7-day rolling average and personal baseline
- **Ignoring subjective-objective conflicts** — When they disagree, err on the side of caution
- **Treating estimates as measurements** — Wearable calorie burns can be off 20-50%; use for relative, not absolute targets
