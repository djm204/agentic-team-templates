# Sleep Optimization

Guidelines for sleep architecture, circadian rhythm management, hygiene protocols, and integration with the broader wellness plan.

## Principles

- **Consistency is king** — Same wake time every day (±30 min) anchors the circadian clock
- **Quality over quantity** — 7 hours at 90% efficiency beats 8 hours at 70%
- **Sleep is a skill** — Requires learned wind-down routine, environmental control, and supporting daytime habits
- **Every domain affects sleep** — Training, caffeine, calories, stress, screens all modulate sleep architecture
- **Respect chronotype** — Work with natural early/late tendencies where possible

## Sleep Quality Metrics

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Needs Attention |
|--------|------|------------|-----------------|
| Total sleep time | 7-9 hours | 6-7 hours | Below 6 |
| Sleep efficiency | Above 90% | 85-90% | Below 85% |
| Sleep onset latency | Under 15 min | 15-30 min | Over 30 min |
| Wake after sleep onset | Under 20 min | 20-40 min | Over 40 min |

## Sleep Architecture Targets

- **Deep Sleep (N3):** 15-25% — Physical recovery, growth hormone, immune repair
- **REM:** 20-25% — Memory consolidation, emotional processing
- **Light Sleep (N1+N2):** 50-60% — Natural proportion when deep/REM optimized
- **Awake:** Less than 5%

## Sleep Environment

Temperature 65-68F (18-20C), blackout curtains or mask, earplugs or white noise, supportive mattress/pillow, electronics out of reach, ventilated room.

## Circadian Rhythm Management

| Timing | Action | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Within 30 min of waking | 10-20 min bright light (sunlight preferred) | Suppresses melatonin, anchors clock |
| 8-10 hours before bed | Caffeine cutoff | Half-life 5-6 hours |
| 3-4 hours before bed | Complete vigorous exercise | Allow core temp drop |
| 2-3 hours before bed | Dim lights, warm-spectrum | Signals melatonin onset |
| 1 hour before bed | No screens or blue-light filter; wind-down routine | Prevents melatonin suppression |

## Wind-Down Routine (30-60 min)

Transition (optional 10-15 min) → Relaxation (15-30 min: reading, stretching, journaling, breathwork) → Final prep (5-10 min) → In-bed relaxation (body scan, 4-7-8 breathing, PMR).

## Sleep Disruptors

- **Caffeine after cutoff** — Increases onset latency, reduces deep sleep
- **Alcohol** — Suppresses REM, fragments second half of night
- **Late intense exercise** — Elevates core temp and cortisol
- **Blue light** — Suppresses melatonin production
- **Irregular schedule** — Desynchronizes circadian clock

## When to Refer

Snoring with gasping/apneas, excessive daytime sleepiness despite 7+ hours (2+ weeks), inability to fall asleep within 45 min (3+ weeks), restless legs nightly, sleep efficiency below 75% despite hygiene optimization (4+ weeks).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Extending bed time without improving efficiency** — Restrict time in bed to actual sleep + 15 min; extend as efficiency improves
- **Weekend schedule shifts** — Recover with earlier bedtime, not later wake time
- **Obsessing over nightly scores** — Use trends over weeks, not nightly judgment
