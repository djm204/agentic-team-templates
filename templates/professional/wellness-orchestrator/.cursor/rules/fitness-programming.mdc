# Fitness Programming

Guidelines for exercise prescription, periodization, recovery, and injury prevention.

## Principles

- **Readiness before intensity** — Check daily readiness score before prescribing intensity
- **Progressive overload with guardrails** — Max 10% week-over-week increase in volume or load
- **Minimum effective dose** — Prescribe least training that produces measurable progress
- **Movement quality before load** — Technique mastery at lighter loads precedes heavy loading
- **Recovery is part of the program** — Deloads, rest days, active recovery are planned, not reactive

## Exercise Prescription

| Parameter | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Frequency | 2-3 full body | 3-5 split | 4-6 specialized |
| Intensity (RPE) | 5-6 | 6-8 | 7-10 (periodized) |
| Sets/muscle/week | 6-10 | 10-16 | 14-22 |
| Deload frequency | Every 6-8 weeks | Every 4-6 weeks | Every 3-5 weeks |

## Readiness-Based Session Selection

| Readiness | Session Type | Adjustment |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 85-100 | Heavy compounds, PR attempts, HIIT | Full planned volume/intensity |
| 70-84 | Normal training as programmed | Full planned |
| 55-69 | Technique work, moderate loads | Reduce 20-30% volume |
| 40-54 | Active recovery, mobility, light cardio | Reduce 50-60%, cap RPE 5 |
| Below 40 | Full rest day or gentle walk | No structured training |

## Periodization

- **Accumulation (3-5 wk):** Higher volume, moderate intensity (RPE 6-8)
- **Intensification (3-4 wk):** Lower volume, higher intensity (RPE 8-9)
- **Realization (1-2 wk):** Low volume, peak intensity (RPE 9-10)
- **Deload (1 wk between blocks):** Volume 40-60%, intensity 70-80%, focus on recovery/mobility

## Recovery Triggers

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Readiness < 50 for 2+ days | Mandatory deload or rest until > 60 |
| Soreness > 72 hours | Avoid loading that group; add foam rolling |
| Resting HR elevated > 5 bpm for 3+ days | Reduce volume 50%, prioritize sleep |
| HRV declining 5+ days | Active recovery only until baseline |
| Joint pain (sharp, not DOMS) | Stop loading; seek professional assessment |

## Injury Prevention

- 5-10 min progressive warm-up every session
- Track push/pull volume parity within 10% weekly
- Include posterior chain work every training day
- Mobility work minimum 3x/week targeting restrictions
- Stay within 10% weekly volume increase; use RPE to auto-regulate

## Anti-Patterns

- **Program hopping** — Commit minimum 6-8 weeks before evaluating
- **Ignoring readiness** — The program is a plan, not a contract; adjust based on signals
- **Skipping deloads** — Fitness is built during recovery, not the workout
