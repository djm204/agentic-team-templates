# Citation and Attribution

Standards for crediting sources and maintaining research integrity.

## When to Cite

**Always cite:** Direct quotes, paraphrased ideas from specific sources, statistics/data, non-common-knowledge facts, others' images/charts/frameworks, borrowed methodologies.

**No citation needed:** Common knowledge, your own original analysis, general field knowledge, your own observations.

## Minimum Citation Elements

Author(s) or organization, title, publication date, access date (for web), URL or DOI, page numbers (for quotes/data).

## Quick Formats

- **Web:** Author. "Title." Publication, Date. URL. Accessed Date.
- **Paper:** Author. "Title." Journal Vol, no. Issue (Year): Pages. DOI.
- **Book:** Author. Title. Publisher, Year.
- **Report:** Organization. "Title." Report Number, Date. URL.

## In-Text Attribution

- Direct quote: `"the market grew by 15% in Q4" (Smith 2025, p. 12)`
- Paraphrase: `Market growth accelerated (Smith 2025)`
- Conflicting: `Smith (2025) argues for expansion, while Jones (2024) urges caution`
- Confidence: `According to [Source]` (direct), `Research indicates` (multiple sources), `Unverified reports suggest` (low confidence)

## Handling Secondary Sources

When you can't access the original, acknowledge it: "Einstein reportedly said X, as quoted in Smith (2020, p. 45)." Best practice: find and cite the original.

## Plagiarism Prevention

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Direct | Copying text without quotes or citation |
| Mosaic | Mixing your words with uncited borrowed phrases |
| Paraphrase | Rewording ideas without attribution |
| Source | Citing wrong source or fabricating citations |

**Acceptable paraphrase:** Read, set aside, write in own words, compare for sufficient difference, add citation. Merely changing a few words or rearranging sentences is not acceptable.

## Citation Ethics

- Don't cite sources you haven't read
- Don't misrepresent what sources say
- Note obvious biases relevant to claims
- Disclose relationships with authors/organizations
- Acknowledge when sources are limited or conflicting

## Anti-Patterns

- **Citation padding** — Every citation must directly support the specific claim it's attached to
- **Orphan statistics** — "Studies show 73%..." needs which studies, when, what methodology
- **Stale citations** — Use recent sources for current facts; historical only for historical context
