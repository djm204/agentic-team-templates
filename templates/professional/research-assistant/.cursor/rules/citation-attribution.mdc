# Citation and Attribution

Standards for properly crediting sources and maintaining research integrity.

## Why Citation Matters

### For Credibility
- Claims without sources are just opinions
- Readers can verify your work
- Demonstrates thoroughness and rigor
- Distinguishes your analysis from others' work

### For Integrity
- Gives credit where due
- Avoids plagiarism
- Enables academic discourse
- Maintains trust in information ecosystem

### For Utility
- Readers can explore further
- Enables reproduction of research
- Creates knowledge trails
- Builds on collective understanding

## Citation Principles

### When to Cite

**Always cite:**
- Direct quotes
- Paraphrased ideas from specific sources
- Statistics and data
- Specific facts not commonly known
- Images, charts, or media from others
- Methodologies or frameworks developed by others

**No citation needed:**
- Common knowledge (Earth orbits the Sun)
- Your own original analysis
- General facts in your field's common understanding
- Your own observations and experiences

### What to Include

Minimum citation elements:
- Author(s) or organization
- Title of work
- Publication date
- Access date (for web sources)
- URL or DOI (for online sources)
- Page numbers (for specific quotes/data)

## Citation Formats

### Quick Reference Formats

**Web Article:**
```text
Author Last, First. "Article Title." Publication Name, Date Published. URL. Accessed Date.

Example:
Smith, John. "Market Trends 2025." Industry Weekly, January 15, 2025. https://example.com/article. Accessed February 3, 2026.
```

**Academic Paper:**
```text
Author Last, First, and Second Author. "Paper Title." Journal Name Vol, no. Issue (Year): Pages. DOI or URL.

Example:
Chen, Wei, and Sarah Johnson. "Machine Learning in Healthcare." Nature Medicine 15, no. 3 (2024): 234-256. https://doi.org/10.1038/example
```

**Book:**
```text
Author Last, First. Book Title. Publisher, Year.

Example:
Brown, Michael. Research Methods for Practitioners. Academic Press, 2023.
```

**Government/Institutional Report:**
```text
Organization. "Report Title." Report Number, Date. URL.

Example:
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Employment Situation Summary." USDL-25-0001, February 2025. https://bls.gov/report
```

**Interview/Personal Communication:**
```text
Name, Title at Organization. Interview by [Your Name], Date. [Method: phone, video, in-person].

Example:
Martinez, Elena, VP of Engineering at TechCorp. Interview by author, January 20, 2026. Video call.
```

### In-Text Citation Styles

**Direct Quote:**
> According to Smith, "the market grew by 15% in Q4" (Smith 2025, p. 12).

**Paraphrase:**
> Market growth accelerated significantly in the final quarter (Smith 2025).

**Multiple Sources:**
> Several studies support this conclusion (Smith 2025; Jones 2024; Chen et al. 2023).

**Conflicting Sources:**
> Smith (2025) argues for expansion, while Jones (2024) urges caution.

## Attribution in Practice

### Research Findings Attribution

```text
# Properly Attributed Finding

**Finding:** Customer acquisition costs increased 23% year-over-year.

**Source:** TechCo Q4 2025 Earnings Report, p. 15. Filed with SEC January 28, 2026.
**Verification:** Confirmed in analyst reports from Morgan Stanley (Jan 29, 2026) and Goldman Sachs (Jan 30, 2026).
**Confidence:** High (primary source + independent corroboration)
```

### Distinguishing Sources of Information

Use clear language to indicate origin:
- "According to [Source]..." - Direct attribution
- "Research indicates..." - Multiple sources support this
- "It has been reported that..." - Secondhand information
- "In my analysis..." - Your own work
- "Unverified reports suggest..." - Low-confidence information

### Handling Secondary Sources

When you can't access the original:

```text
Poor: "Einstein said 'imagination is more important than knowledge.'"
(Implies you read Einstein's original work)

Better: "Einstein reportedly said 'imagination is more important than knowledge,' as quoted in Smith's biography (Smith 2020, p. 45)."
(Acknowledges you're citing a secondary source)

Best: Find and cite the original source.
```

## Plagiarism Prevention

### What Constitutes Plagiarism

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Copying text without quotes or citation | Copying a paragraph verbatim |
| **Mosaic** | Mixing your words with uncited borrowed phrases | Slight rewording without citation |
| **Paraphrase** | Rewording ideas without attribution | Restating someone's argument as your own |
| **Self** | Reusing your own prior work without disclosure | Submitting same analysis twice |
| **Source** | Citing wrong source or fabricating citations | Citing paper you didn't read |

### Prevention Checklist

Before finalizing any research output:

- [ ] Every quote has quotation marks and citation
- [ ] Every paraphrase has attribution
- [ ] Statistics and data points have sources
- [ ] Borrowed frameworks/methodologies are credited
- [ ] Secondary sources are identified as such
- [ ] Your own analysis is clearly distinguished
- [ ] All citations are accurate and accessible

### Paraphrasing Guidelines

**Acceptable Paraphrase:**
1. Read and understand the original
2. Set the original aside
3. Write the idea in your own words
4. Compare to original to ensure sufficient difference
5. Add citation

**Unacceptable Paraphrase:**
- Changing a few words while keeping structure
- Using synonyms for key terms
- Rearranging sentences
- Combining phrases from original into new sentences

## Source Management

### Reference Management Tools

| Tool | Best For | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| Zotero | Academics, free | Browser capture, PDF storage, citation generation |
| Mendeley | Researchers, PDF annotation | Social features, PDF reader |
| EndNote | Institutional use | Comprehensive, expensive |
| Notion/Obsidian | Flexible workflows | Customizable, links to notes |

## Citation Ethics

### Accurate Representation

- Don't cite sources you haven't read
- Don't misrepresent what sources say
- Include context that might qualify claims
- Cite the actual source of an idea, not just a convenient one

### Conflict of Interest Disclosure

When citing sources:
- Note if source has obvious bias relevant to the claim
- Disclose if you have relationship with author/organization
- Flag if source is funded by interested parties

### Acknowledging Limitations

In your own work:
- Note when sources are limited or conflicting
- Acknowledge gaps in available evidence
- Be clear about what your sources do and don't support

## Common Citation Errors

### Citation Padding

Wrong: Add citations to appear thorough without actually supporting the claim.

Right: Every citation should directly support the specific claim it's attached to.

### Orphan Statistics

Wrong: "Studies show that 73% of customers prefer..."
(Which studies? When? What methodology?)

Right: "According to a 2025 McKinsey survey of 1,200 retail customers, 73% preferred..." (McKinsey 2025, p. 8)

### Stale Citations

Wrong: Cite a 2010 source for current market conditions.

Right: Use recent sources for current facts; historical sources only for historical context.

### Access Barrier Ignorance

Wrong: Cite paywalled source knowing readers can't verify.

Right: Note access requirements; prefer open-access when available; archive key sources.
