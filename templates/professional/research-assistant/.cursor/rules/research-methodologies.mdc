# Research Methodologies

Systematic approaches for different types of research challenges.

## Methodology Selection

| Research Type | Primary Goal | Key Methods | Typical Sources |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Academic | Advance knowledge | Literature/systematic review | Journals, conferences, preprints |
| Investigative | Uncover hidden info | Document analysis, FOIA, interviews | Primary documents, records |
| Market | Inform decisions | Surveys, competitive intel | Industry reports, filings, experts |
| Technical | Solve problems | Doc review, experimentation | Docs, code, specs, forums |
| Due Diligence | Assess risk | Background checks, verification | Public records, references |

## Academic Research

**Literature review process:** Define question (PICO format) → Develop search protocol (databases, terms, criteria) → Execute (document all queries) → Screen (title/abstract, then full-text) → Extract data → Synthesize (themes, contradictions, evidence quality) → Report.

**Citation analysis:** Forward (who cites this), backward (reference list), co-citation (frequently cited together), author tracking. Check preprints for paywalled papers.

## Investigative Research

**Document flow:** Identify what documents should exist → Determine who holds them → Acquire (FOIA, court filings, regulatory filings) → Analyze (timeline, relationships, patterns) → Fill gaps (interviews, additional requests) → Verify across sources.

## OSINT Techniques

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Social media analysis | Track individuals, organizations, events |
| Domain/IP research | Identify ownership (WHOIS, Shodan) |
| Image analysis | Verify photos (reverse image search, ExifTool) |
| Corporate records | Ownership, officers (OpenCorporates, state DBs) |
| Archive research | Historical/deleted content (Wayback Machine) |

## Market and Competitive Research

**Competitive intelligence:** Basic profile → Financial analysis (filings, funding) → Strategic analysis (stated vs. revealed strategy, M&A) → Operational intel (tech stack from job postings, patent activity, hiring patterns) → Strengths/weaknesses (reviews, employee sentiment).

**Market sizing approaches:** Top-down (total → segment → target), bottom-up (unit economics × customers), value theory (value × willingness to pay), analogous (similar market × adjustments).

## Technical Research

Define requirements → Landscape survey → Deep evaluation (docs, community health, security, benchmarks) → Proof of concept → Weighted scoring decision.

## Matching Rigor to Stakes

- **Low stakes:** Quick search, single source OK
- **Medium stakes:** Multiple sources, basic verification
- **High stakes:** Systematic methodology, full documentation, expert review
