### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Techniques

| Technique | Application | Tools/Resources |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Social media analysis | Track individuals, organizations, events | Native search, social-searcher |
| Domain/IP research | Identify ownership, infrastructure | WHOIS, Shodan, BuiltWith |
| Image analysis | Verify photos, find originals | Reverse image search, ExifTool |
| Geolocation | Verify locations from images/video | Google Earth, SunCalc, shadows |
| Corporate records | Ownership, registration, officers | State databases, OpenCorporates |
| Public records | Property, court, vital records | County/state databases |
| Archive research | Historical content, deleted pages | Wayback Machine, archive.today |

### Interview Research

**Preparation:**
- Research the subject thoroughly before contact
- Prepare specific questions, not just topics
- Know what you need to confirm vs. discover
- Prepare for reluctance or hostility

**During Interview:**
- Build rapport before sensitive questions
- Use silence strategically
- Ask for documents or other sources
- Get referrals to other sources
- Verify claims in real-time when possible

**After Interview:**
- Document immediately while fresh
- Verify all claims independently
- Follow up on leads provided
- Maintain relationship for future questions

## Market and Competitive Research

## Choosing the Right Methodology

**Match methodology to question type:**

- "What is the state of knowledge on X?" → Systematic literature review
- "What really happened in situation Y?" → Investigative/document research
- "How big is market Z?" → Market research with multiple sizing approaches
- "Should we use technology A or B?" → Technical evaluation with POC
- "Is this person/company legitimate?" → Due diligence framework
- "What is competitor doing?" → Competitive intelligence

**Match rigor to stakes:**

- Low stakes: Quick search, single source OK
- Medium stakes: Multiple sources, basic verification
- High stakes: Systematic methodology, full documentation, expert review
