# Search Strategies

Master-level techniques for finding information that others miss.

## Key Search Operators

| Operator | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `"exact phrase"` | Match exact words | `"supply chain disruption"` |
| `site:` | Search within domain | `site:gov climate data` |
| `-` | Exclude term | `apple -fruit` |
| `OR` | Either term | `CEO OR "chief executive"` |
| `filetype:` | File format | `filetype:pdf annual report` |
| `intitle:` | Term in page title | `intitle:methodology` |
| `before:/after:` | Date range | `after:2024-01-01` |

**Power combinations:** `site:gov filetype:pdf "topic"`, `"topic" site:edu -site:wikipedia.org`, `"company" (site:reuters.com OR site:bloomberg.com) after:2025-01-01`

## Source-Specific Databases

| Source Type | Examples | Best For |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Academic | Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR, arXiv, SSRN | Peer-reviewed research |
| Government | SEC EDGAR, PACER, Data.gov, Federal Register | Official records, filings |
| News | Reuters, AP, AFP, trade publications | Primary reporting |
| Corporate | SEC filings, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, patent databases | Company intelligence |
| Archives | Wayback Machine, archive.today, Google Cache | Removed/changed content |

## Query Iteration Strategy

1. `[broad topic]`
2. `[topic] + [specific aspect]`
3. `"exact phrase" + [specific aspect]`
4. `"exact phrase" site:authoritative-domain`
5. `"exact phrase" filetype:pdf after:2024`

**Synonym expansion:** Try technical vs. colloquial terms, British vs. American spelling, acronyms vs. full names, historical vs. current terminology.

## Following Citation Trails

When you find a good source: check its references, search for papers citing it, find other work by the same author, search for rebuttals, look for updates or corrections.

## Search Documentation

Log every search: research question, exact query, engine used, date, results reviewed, useful finds (with URLs), dead ends, next refinement. This enables reproducibility, avoids repeating failures, and shows how conclusions were reached.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Default search only** — Use multiple engines, specialized databases, and advanced operators
- **Keyword fixation** — Vary terminology; experts use different words than beginners
- **Recency bias** — Historical sources contain primary evidence summaries miss
- **Source monoculture** — Deliberately seek diverse source types (academic, journalistic, governmental, industry)
