# Search Strategies

Master-level techniques for finding information that others miss.

## Search Operator Mastery

### Google Advanced Operators

| Operator | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `"exact phrase"` | Match exact words in order | `"supply chain disruption"` |
| `site:` | Search within specific domain | `site:gov climate data` |
| `-` | Exclude term | `apple -fruit -cider` |
| `OR` | Either term | `CEO OR "chief executive"` |
| `*` | Wildcard for unknown words | `"* is the new *"` |
| `filetype:` | Specific file format | `filetype:pdf annual report` |
| `intitle:` | Term in page title | `intitle:methodology` |
| `inurl:` | Term in URL | `inurl:research` |
| `before:` / `after:` | Date range | `after:2024-01-01` |
| `related:` | Similar sites | `related:reuters.com` |
| `cache:` | Google's cached version | `cache:example.com/page` |
| `define:` | Dictionary definition | `define:epistemology` |

### Operator Combinations

```text
# Find PDFs from government sites about a topic
site:gov filetype:pdf "climate change" "annual report"

# Find academic discussions excluding Wikipedia
"machine learning" site:edu -site:wikipedia.org

# Find recent news from specific sources
"company name" (site:reuters.com OR site:bloomberg.com) after:2025-01-01

# Find presentations and slide decks
"topic" (filetype:ppt OR filetype:pptx OR filetype:pdf) "slide"

# Find data files
"dataset name" (filetype:csv OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:json)
```

## Source-Specific Search Tactics

### Academic Research

| Database | Best For | Access |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Google Scholar | Broad academic search, citation tracking | Free |
| Semantic Scholar | AI/ML papers, citation context | Free |
| PubMed | Medical and life sciences | Free |
| JSTOR | Humanities and social sciences | Library access |
| arXiv | Physics, math, CS preprints | Free |
| SSRN | Social sciences, economics | Free |
| IEEE Xplore | Engineering, computer science | Paid/Library |
| Web of Science | Citation analysis, impact metrics | Paid/Library |

**Academic Search Tips:**
- Use author name in quotes: `"Smith, J"` or `author:smith`
- Search by DOI when you have it
- Use citation tracking to find related work
- Check if preprints exist on arXiv or SSRN for paywalled papers
- Request papers directly from authors via ResearchGate or email

### Government and Legal Documents

| Source | Content | URL Pattern |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| SEC EDGAR | Corporate filings, 10-K, 8-K | sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar |
| PACER | Federal court records | pacer.uscourts.gov |
| Congress.gov | Legislation, hearings | congress.gov |
| Federal Register | Regulations, rules | federalregister.gov |
| USPTO | Patents | patents.google.com, uspto.gov |
| Data.gov | Government datasets | data.gov |
| FOIA libraries | Declassified documents | Various agency sites |

**Government Search Tips:**
- Use `site:gov` to restrict to official sources
- Check the Wayback Machine for removed pages
- FOIA requests can take months but yield unique data
- State-level equivalents exist for most federal databases

### News and Current Events

| Source Type | Examples | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Wire services | Reuters, AP, AFP | Breaking news, primary reporting |
| Quality dailies | NYT, WSJ, FT, Economist | Analysis, investigation |
| Trade publications | Industry-specific | Specialized knowledge |
| Local news | Regional papers | Ground-level reporting |
| News aggregators | Google News, Techmeme | Discovery |

**News Search Tips:**
- Use date filters aggressively
- Check multiple ideological perspectives for bias awareness
- Local news often has details missing from national coverage
- Trade publications know their industry better than generalists
- Wayback Machine preserves deleted articles

### Corporate Information

| Source | Information Type |
|--------|-----------------|
| SEC filings | Financial statements, risk factors, executive compensation |
| Company websites | Press releases, investor relations |
| LinkedIn | Employee counts, growth, key personnel |
| Glassdoor/Blind | Internal culture, problems |
| Crunchbase | Funding, investors, acquisitions |
| Patent databases | R&D direction, technology strategy |
| Job postings | Strategic priorities, tech stack |

## Hidden Web Techniques

### Beyond Page 1

Most searchers never go past page 1. Deep results often contain:
- Academic and technical content
- Older but still relevant sources
- Niche sites with specialized knowledge
- Primary sources overlooked by aggregators

### Finding Removed Content

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Wayback Machine (archive.org) | Historical snapshots of pages |
| Google Cache | Recent cached version |
| archive.today | Alternative web archive |
| CachedView | Aggregates multiple caches |

### Specialized Search Engines

| Engine | Specialty |
|--------|-----------|
| Shodan | Internet-connected devices |
| Carrot2 | Clustered search results |
| Wolfram Alpha | Computational knowledge |
| BoardReader | Forum and message board search |
| Social Searcher | Social media content |

## Query Iteration Strategy

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

```text
Iteration 1: [topic]
Iteration 2: [topic] [specific aspect]
Iteration 3: "exact phrase" [specific aspect]
Iteration 4: "exact phrase" site:authoritative-domain.com
Iteration 5: "exact phrase" filetype:pdf site:edu after:2023
```

### Synonym Expansion

For any search term, also try:
- Technical vs. colloquial terms
- British vs. American spelling
- Acronyms vs. full names
- Historical vs. current terminology

### Following Trails

When you find a good source:
1. Check its references/bibliography
2. Search for papers that cite it
3. Find other work by the same author
4. Search for rebuttals or critiques
5. Look for subsequent updates or corrections

## Search Documentation

### Query Log Template

```text
Research Question: [Question being investigated]

Search #1:
- Query: [exact search string]
- Engine: [Google/Scholar/etc.]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Results reviewed: [First N results]
- Useful finds: [List with URLs]
- Dead ends: [What didn't work]
- Next iteration: [How to refine]

Search #2:
...
```

### Why Document Searches?

- Reproducibility: Others can verify your work
- Efficiency: Avoid repeating failed approaches
- Completeness: Ensure thorough coverage
- Transparency: Show how conclusions were reached

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Reliance on Default Search

Wrong: Type question into Google, accept first answer.

Right: Use multiple search engines, specialized databases, and advanced operators. First results are optimized for clicks, not accuracy.

### Keyword Fixation

Wrong: Keep searching with the same keywords expecting different results.

Right: Vary terminology. Experts use different words than beginners. Academic papers use different terms than news articles.

### Recency Bias in Search

Wrong: Only look at recent results, assuming newer is better.

Right: Historical sources often contain primary evidence or foundational understanding that recent summaries miss.

### Source Monoculture

Wrong: All sources from the same domain, publication type, or perspective.

Right: Deliberately seek diverse source types: academic, journalistic, governmental, industry, international.
