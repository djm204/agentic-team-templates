# Source Evaluation

Rigorous techniques for assessing credibility, detecting bias, and verifying claims.

## CRAAP Test

| Criterion | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Currency** | When published? Updated? |
| **Relevance** | Does it address your question directly? At what depth? |
| **Authority** | Who created it? Credentials? Conflicts of interest? |
| **Accuracy** | Evidence-based? Verifiable claims? Citations? |
| **Purpose** | Inform, sell, persuade, or entertain? Hidden agenda? |

## Source Credibility Tiers

- **Tier 1 (Primary):** Original documents, court records, raw data, firsthand interviews
- **Tier 2 (High Secondary):** Peer-reviewed papers, wire services, established investigative journalism
- **Tier 3 (General Secondary):** Quality newspapers, trade press, reputable books, institutional research
- **Tier 4 (User-Generated):** Wikipedia, social media, blogs, forums, self-published content
- **Tier 5 (Unreliable):** Anonymous without corroboration, content farms, heavily biased advocacy, outdated

## Bias Detection

| Bias Type | Detection Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Selection | Look for what's omitted |
| Confirmation | Search for contrary evidence |
| Funding | Check who paid for the research |
| Publication | Look for null results, replications |
| Survivorship | Ask about failures |

**Language red flags:** Loaded/emotional language, absolutist terms, ad hominem attacks, missing nuance, excessive superlatives.

**Structural red flags:** No counterarguments, single-perspective sources, data without context, conclusions exceeding evidence.

## Verification Techniques

For any significant claim:
1. **Find the original source** — Trace through citations to primary
2. **Check corroboration** — At least 2 independent sources confirming
3. **Look for contradictions** — Actively search for disagreement
4. **Verify quotes** — Check full context, not just excerpts
5. **Confirm numbers** — Cross-reference statistics and timelines

## Evaluating Authors

Check: relevant credentials, professional experience, institutional affiliation, other publications. Check for: financial relationships, ideological commitments, organizational stakes, previous corrections/retractions.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Credentialism fallacy** — Credentials matter but aren't sufficient; verify claims regardless
- **False balance** — Don't treat fringe views as equivalent to consensus
- **Source laundering** — Multiple outlets may cite the same unverified original; trace to source
