# Source Evaluation

Rigorous techniques for assessing credibility, detecting bias, and verifying claims.

## The CRAAP Test Framework

| Criterion | Questions to Ask | Red Flags |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Currency** | When was it published? Updated? | No date, very old with no updates |
| **Relevance** | Does it address your question? At what depth? | Tangential, superficial treatment |
| **Authority** | Who created it? What are their credentials? | Anonymous, no credentials, conflicts of interest |
| **Accuracy** | Is it supported by evidence? Can you verify claims? | No citations, unverifiable claims, errors |
| **Purpose** | Why does this exist? Inform, sell, persuade, entertain? | Hidden agenda, emotional manipulation |

## Source Credibility Tiers

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (Highest Credibility)

- Original documents (contracts, transcripts, data)
- Direct observation or participation
- Court records, government filings
- Raw data and datasets
- Firsthand interviews

### Tier 2: High-Quality Secondary Sources

- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Major wire services (Reuters, AP, AFP)
- Established investigative journalism (with named sources)
- Official government reports
- Professional organization publications

### Tier 3: General Secondary Sources

- Quality newspapers and magazines
- Industry publications and trade press
- Books from reputable publishers
- Recognized subject matter experts
- Institutional research

### Tier 4: User-Generated and Social Content

- Wikipedia (use as starting point, not endpoint)
- Social media posts
- Blog posts and opinion pieces
- Forum discussions
- Self-published content

### Tier 5: Potentially Unreliable

- Anonymous sources without corroboration
- Content farms and clickbait sites
- Heavily biased advocacy content
- Outdated information on rapidly changing topics
- AI-generated content without human verification

## Bias Detection

### Types of Bias

| Bias Type | Description | Detection Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Selection Bias** | Cherry-picking data or examples | Look for what's omitted |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking evidence that supports pre-existing beliefs | Search for contrary evidence |
| **Funding Bias** | Results favor funders | Check who paid for the research |
| **Publication Bias** | Positive results more likely to be published | Look for null results, replications |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Only successful examples visible | Ask about failures |
| **Anchoring Bias** | Over-relying on first information encountered | Seek independent second opinions |

### Bias Indicators

**Language Red Flags:**
- Loaded or emotional language
- Absolutist terms (always, never, everyone)
- Ad hominem attacks on opposing views
- Missing qualifications or nuance
- Excessive use of superlatives

**Structural Red Flags:**
- No counterarguments addressed
- Sources all from one perspective
- Data presented without context
- Conclusions that exceed the evidence
- Missing methodology description

### Evaluating Author/Publisher

└── Transparency
    ├── Methods disclosed?
    ├── Data available?
    ├── Funding acknowledged?
    └── Limitations discussed?
```

## Verification Techniques

### Claim Verification Checklist

For any significant claim:

1. **Find the original source** - Trace back through citations to the primary source
2. **Check for corroboration** - At least 2 independent sources confirming
3. **Look for contradictions** - Actively search for sources that disagree
4. **Verify quotes** - Check full context, not just excerpts
5. **Confirm dates and numbers** - Cross-reference statistics and timelines
6. **Check images** - Reverse image search for manipulation or misattribution

### Fact-Checking Resources

| Resource | Specialty |
|----------|-----------|
| Snopes | Rumors, urban legends, viral claims |
| PolitiFact | Political statements |
| FactCheck.org | Political claims and policy |
| Full Fact (UK) | UK-focused fact-checking |
| AP Fact Check | News and political claims |
| Science Feedback | Scientific claims |
| Media Bias/Fact Check | Publication bias ratings |

### Statistical Claim Verification

When encountering statistics:

1. **Find the original study** - Not a summary or media report
2. **Check sample size** - Is it large enough to be meaningful?
3. **Understand methodology** - How was data collected?
4. **Look at confidence intervals** - How certain is the finding?
5. **Check for cherry-picking** - Is this one data point from a larger set?
6. **Consider base rates** - Is the comparison appropriate?
7. **Beware of correlation vs. causation** - Association is not causation

## Source Comparison Matrix

When evaluating multiple sources on the same topic:

```text
| Source | Date | Author Credentials | Methodology | Conflicts | Conclusion | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Source A | | | | | | |
| Source B | | | | | | |
| Source C | | | | | | |

Agreement areas: [List]
Disagreement areas: [List]
Information gaps: [List]
Most credible source for this question: [Choice with reasoning]
```

## Red Flag Catalog

### Immediate Credibility Concerns

- No author attribution
- No publication date
- Broken or circular citations
- Domain is content farm or known misinformation source
- Excessive advertising or clickbait design
- Claims to be "the truth they don't want you to know"
- No contact information or about page
- Recently created domain with authoritative-sounding name

### Claims That Require Extra Scrutiny

- "Studies show" without citing specific studies
- Single study presented as consensus
- Extraordinary claims (require extraordinary evidence)
- Claims that align too perfectly with partisan positions
- Statistics without source or methodology
- Anecdotes presented as evidence
- Expert quotes without verifiable attribution

## Common Evaluation Errors

### Credentialism Fallacy

Wrong: Source is credible because author has a PhD.

Right: Credentials matter but are not sufficient. Check if credentials are relevant to the claim and if the person has conflicts of interest.

### Appeal to Authority

Wrong: Accept claim because it comes from prestigious institution.

Right: Even prestigious sources make errors. Verify the specific claim, not just the source reputation.

### False Balance

Wrong: Treat fringe views as equivalent to scientific consensus.

Right: Weight sources by evidence quality, not just for "balance." One outlier study doesn't equal hundreds of confirming studies.

### Source Laundering

Wrong: Accept claim because multiple outlets report it.

Right: Trace to original source. Multiple outlets may all be citing the same original (unverified) source.
