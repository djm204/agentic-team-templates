# Information Synthesis

Techniques for combining disparate findings into coherent, actionable understanding.

## The Synthesis Process

```text
Information Synthesis Pipeline
├── 1. Organize Raw Findings
│   ├── Catalog all sources and key claims
│   ├── Tag by topic, source type, and credibility
│   └── Note gaps and contradictions
├── 2. Identify Patterns
│   ├── What do multiple sources agree on?
│   ├── Where do sources diverge?
│   ├── What themes emerge?
│   └── What causal relationships appear?
├── 3. Reconcile Contradictions
│   ├── Examine methodology differences
│   ├── Consider context and timing
│   ├── Assess source quality
│   └── Flag unresolved conflicts
├── 4. Build Understanding
│   ├── Construct narrative from evidence
│   ├── Test against all available data
│   ├── Identify remaining uncertainties
│   └── Form conclusions with confidence levels
├── 5. Validate
│   ├── Seek disconfirming evidence
│   ├── Test with knowledgeable others
│   ├── Consider alternative explanations
│   └── Check for logical consistency
└── 6. Communicate
    ├── Lead with key insights
    ├── Provide evidence chain
    ├── Acknowledge limitations
    └── Suggest next steps
```

## Analysis Frameworks

### SWOT Analysis (Strategic Assessment)

| Category | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Strengths** | What advantages exist? What works well? What unique resources? |
| **Weaknesses** | What could be improved? What is lacking? What should be avoided? |
| **Opportunities** | What good chances are available? What trends could be leveraged? |
| **Threats** | What obstacles exist? What is competition doing? What could cause trouble? |

### Five Whys (Root Cause Analysis)

When investigating a problem:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat until you reach root cause(s)
5. Typically 5 iterations reveal underlying issues

### Argument Mapping

For evaluating claims and reasoning:

```text
Main Claim
├── Supporting Evidence 1
│   ├── Sub-evidence 1a
│   └── Sub-evidence 1b
├── Supporting Evidence 2
├── Counter-evidence 1
│   └── Rebuttal to counter-evidence
└── Counter-evidence 2 (unaddressed)
```

### Comparative Matrix

For comparing options or sources:

| Factor | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Factor 1] | [1-5] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
| [Factor 2] | [1-5] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
| [Factor 3] | [1-5] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
| **Weighted Total** | | [Sum] | [Sum] | [Sum] |

### Timeline Analysis

For understanding sequences and causation:

```text
Timeline: [Topic]

[Date 1] - [Event 1]
           └── Key actors: [Names]
           └── Significance: [Why it matters]

[Date 2] - [Event 2]
           └── Caused by: [Link to prior event]
           └── Led to: [Subsequent developments]
```

## Pattern Recognition

### Types of Patterns to Seek

| Pattern Type | Description | Questions to Ask |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Convergence | Multiple sources agree | Why do they agree? Same original source? |
| Divergence | Sources disagree | What explains the difference? |
| Silence | Expected information missing | Why isn't this discussed? |
| Anomaly | Unexpected finding | Is this signal or noise? |
| Trend | Change over time | What's driving the change? |
| Correlation | Things that co-occur | Is there causation? Confounding? |

### Detecting Hidden Connections

- Map relationships between people, organizations, and events
- Look for common board members, investors, or advisors
- Track money flows and financial relationships
- Identify shared addresses, phone numbers, or domains
- Note timing coincidences

### Absence as Evidence

Sometimes what's missing is informative:
- Company doesn't disclose standard metric (hiding weakness?)
- Expert avoids specific question (uncomfortable topic?)
- Historical gap in records (something happened?)
- Source doesn't cite expected authorities (not familiar with field?)

## Handling Contradictions

### Contradiction Resolution Framework

```text
When sources disagree:

1. Verify you understand each position correctly
   └── Are they actually saying different things?
   └── Or using different definitions?

2. Examine methodology
   └── Different data collection methods?
   └── Different time periods or populations?
   └── Different analytical approaches?

3. Consider context
   └── Has the situation changed over time?
   └── Different geographic or cultural contexts?
   └── Different stakeholder perspectives?

4. Assess source quality
   └── Is one source more authoritative?
   └── Does one have better evidence?
   └── Are there conflicts of interest?

5. Seek resolution
   └── Can both be partially correct?
   └── Is there a synthesis that explains both?
   └── Should the disagreement be flagged as unresolved?
```

### When Contradictions Remain

Not all contradictions can be resolved. Document:
- The specific points of disagreement
- The best evidence on each side
- Why resolution isn't possible
- What additional information might resolve it

## Confidence Levels

### Confidence Scale

| Level | Definition | Use When |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **High** | Very likely true; strong, consistent evidence from multiple credible sources | 3+ independent high-quality sources agree; evidence is direct and verified |
| **Medium** | Probably true; good evidence but some uncertainty | 2+ sources agree; evidence is solid but indirect or has minor gaps |
| **Low** | Possibly true; limited or conflicting evidence | Single source; evidence is circumstantial; sources conflict |
| **Speculative** | Unknown; insufficient evidence to assess | No direct evidence; inference only; significant gaps |

### Communicating Uncertainty

Use precise language:
- "The evidence strongly suggests..." (High confidence)
- "It appears likely that..." (Medium confidence)  
- "Some sources indicate..." (Low confidence)
- "We cannot determine from available evidence..." (Speculative)

Avoid:
- Stating speculation as fact
- Hedging everything equally
- Failing to distinguish confidence levels

## Common Synthesis Errors

### Premature Closure

Wrong: Reach conclusion quickly, then only seek confirming evidence.

Right: Keep synthesizing as new information arrives. Actively seek disconfirming evidence until the end.

### Equal Weighting

Wrong: Treat all sources as equally credible.

Right: Weight evidence by source quality, directness, and corroboration.

### Narrative Over Evidence

Wrong: Build a compelling story that doesn't match all the evidence.

Right: Let the evidence drive the narrative. Uncomfortable facts must be addressed, not ignored.

### Overconfidence

Wrong: Present conclusions with more certainty than evidence supports.

Right: Explicitly state confidence levels and what could change your conclusion.

### Missing Alternatives

Wrong: Compare only the obvious options.

Right: Consider null hypothesis, unconventional alternatives, and the option to gather more information.
