# Information Synthesis

Techniques for combining disparate findings into coherent, actionable understanding.

## Synthesis Process

1. **Organize** — Catalog sources, tag by topic/credibility, note gaps and contradictions
2. **Identify Patterns** — What do sources agree on? Where do they diverge? What themes emerge?
3. **Reconcile Contradictions** — Examine methodology differences, consider context/timing, assess source quality
4. **Build Understanding** — Construct narrative from evidence, test against all data, assign confidence levels
5. **Validate** — Seek disconfirming evidence, consider alternative explanations, check logical consistency
6. **Communicate** — Lead with insights, provide evidence chains, acknowledge limitations

## Analysis Frameworks

**Argument Mapping:** Main Claim → Supporting Evidence (with sub-evidence) + Counter-evidence (with rebuttals or unaddressed).

**Comparative Matrix:** Factors (weighted 1-5) scored per option, weighted totals compared.

**SWOT:** Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats — with specific questions for each.

**Five Whys:** State problem → Ask "Why?" iteratively (typically 5 times) to reach root cause.

**Timeline Analysis:** Events with dates, key actors, significance, causal links, and subsequent developments.

## Pattern Recognition

| Pattern | Description | Key Question |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Convergence | Multiple sources agree | Same original source? |
| Divergence | Sources disagree | What explains the difference? |
| Silence | Expected info missing | Why isn't this discussed? |
| Anomaly | Unexpected finding | Signal or noise? |
| Trend | Change over time | What's driving it? |
| Correlation | Things co-occur | Causation? Confounding? |

## Handling Contradictions

1. Verify you understand each position (different definitions?)
2. Examine methodology (different methods, periods, populations?)
3. Consider context (changed over time? different perspectives?)
4. Assess source quality (one more authoritative? conflicts of interest?)
5. Seek resolution (both partially correct? unresolvable? flag it)

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Definition | Criteria |
|-------|------------|----------|
| High | Very likely true | 3+ independent quality sources agree |
| Medium | Probably true | 2+ sources agree, minor gaps |
| Low | Possibly true | Single source, conflicting evidence |
| Speculative | Unknown | No direct evidence, inference only |

Use precise language: "evidence strongly suggests" (high), "appears likely" (medium), "some sources indicate" (low), "cannot determine from available evidence" (speculative).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Premature closure** — Keep synthesizing as new info arrives; seek disconfirming evidence
- **Equal weighting** — Weight evidence by source quality, directness, and corroboration
- **Narrative over evidence** — Let evidence drive narrative; address uncomfortable facts
