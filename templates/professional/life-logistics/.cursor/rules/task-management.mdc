# Task Management and Delegation

Guidelines for classifying, automating, tracking, and delegating life logistics tasks.

## Core Principles

- **Systematize before delegating** — A task without a documented process cannot be delegated reliably
- **Calendar is source of truth** — Every deadline, renewal, and recurring task must exist in the calendar with lead-time reminders
- **Batch similar tasks** — Group calls, errands, and admin work into dedicated blocks
- **Redundant reminders for high-stakes items** — Insurance, tax, legal deadlines get reminders at 60, 30, 14, and 3 days
- **Review quarterly** — Audit automated systems and recurring tasks; remove obsolete items

## Task Classification

**By recurrence:** Fixed schedule (automate or calendar), event-triggered (set monitoring alerts), one-time (track to completion and archive).

**By handling:** Fully automated (autopay with verification), calendar-driven manual (reminder + checklist), delegatable (clear brief needed), personal only (requires your judgment/presence).

## Automation Standards

For any autopay/auto-renewal: verify funding source balance, set calendar reminder on processing date, review charges quarterly for rate changes, maintain master autopay list, update all links immediately when payment methods change.

## Delegation Protocol

Every delegated task includes:
1. Clear description of what, why, and when
2. Decision boundaries (independent vs. approval needed)
3. Context (account numbers, contacts, budget, preferences)
4. Deliverable definition and report-back format
5. Intermediate check-in point for longer tasks

## Deadline and Renewal Tracking

Maintain centralized tracker: item/provider, date, required action, lead time needed, current status. Review at start of each month; flag items due within 60 days that haven't been started.

## Quarterly Review Checklist

- Autopay arrangements on correct payment method?
- Any recurring tasks obsolete or changed frequency?
- Deadlines in next 90 days without action plans?
- Provider terms changed?
- Delegation handoffs completing on time?
