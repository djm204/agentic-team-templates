# Accessibility and Inclusive Education

Universal Design for Learning and practices for reaching every learner.

## Universal Design for Learning (CAST)

- **Representation** (the "what") — Provide content in multiple formats (text + visual, audio + text), define key vocabulary, activate prior knowledge
- **Action & Expression** (the "how") — Allow multiple ways to demonstrate understanding (written, verbal, visual, multimedia), provide scaffolds and templates
- **Engagement** (the "why") — Offer meaningful choices, foster collaboration with clear roles, develop self-assessment skills

### Lesson Checklist

- Content available in 2+ formats
- Learners have multiple ways to demonstrate understanding
- Scaffolds available (templates, organizers, exemplars)
- Meaningful choices and clear, relevant goals

## Differentiated Instruction (Tomlinson)

Differentiate by:
- **Content** — Same concept, different complexity or resources
- **Process** — Same goal, different activities or scaffolding
- **Product** — Same objectives, different output formats
- **Environment** — Different grouping and settings

Strategies: tiered assignments, flexible grouping, learning menus/choice boards, anchor activities for early finishers, curriculum compacting via pre-test.

## Learning Styles: The Myth

The "learning styles" model (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) is NOT supported by research (Pashler 2008, Rogowsky 2015). What works: multiple representations for ALL learners (UDL), matching modality to CONTENT type (maps for geography, audio for music).

## Accessible Materials

- **Text** — Sans-serif 12pt+, high contrast (4.5:1), left-aligned, 1.5 line spacing, clear heading hierarchy
- **Images** — Alt text for meaningful images, no info conveyed by color alone
- **Video** — Captions, audio descriptions, transcripts
- **Documents** — Proper heading structure, table headers, descriptive links, logical reading order
- **Assessment** — Extended time when appropriate, alternative formats, clear instructions with examples

## Inclusive Content

- Use diverse names, contexts, and scenarios in examples
- Avoid stereotypes; represent multiple cultures and perspectives
- Asset-based framing: focus on what learners bring, not what they lack
- Hold rigorous standards while providing support to meet them

## Supporting Diverse Learners

- **ELL** — Visual supports, sentence frames, word walls, extended wait time, bilingual peer pairing
- **Disabilities** — Focus on barriers to remove, not deficits; flexible materials/timing/technology
- **Advanced** — Depth and complexity (not more work), independent study, curriculum compacting

❌ "You finished early? Do 10 more problems"
✅ "You've mastered this. Here's a challenge extending the concept"
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Labeling students by "learning style" and restricting to one modality
- Lowering expectations instead of providing scaffolding
- Treating accessibility as an afterthought rather than designing for it upfront
