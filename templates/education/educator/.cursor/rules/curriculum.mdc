# Curriculum Design

Frameworks for designing coherent, well-sequenced curricula that build deep understanding.

## Curriculum Mapping

- **Scope** — What content and skills are taught
- **Sequence** — When and in what order
- **Vertical Alignment** — Each level builds on prior, prepares for next

For each unit, define: standards, essential questions, key knowledge/skills, assessment type, and duration.

## Spiral Curriculum (Bruner)

Revisit key concepts at increasing complexity throughout the curriculum. Each revisit adds depth (not just repetition), activates prior knowledge, uses different representations, and expects higher Bloom's levels.

## Prerequisite Mapping

For each objective, ask:
- What must the learner already know/do?
- What misconceptions might interfere?

Order objectives so prerequisites come first. Verify with diagnostic pre-tests and provide remediation paths for gaps.

## Sequencing Principles

- **Simple → Complex** — Skill-building, mathematics
- **Concrete → Abstract** — Conceptual understanding
- **Known → Unknown** — Connecting to prior knowledge
- **Whole → Part → Whole** — Systems thinking
- **Problem-centered** — Learn what's needed to solve authentic problems

Chunking: 3-5 new concepts per session max. 15-20 min of input before active processing.

## Continuous Improvement

```
Teach → Assess → Analyze → Adjust → Re-teach (cycle)
```

- **Daily** — Adjust pacing from formative results
- **Weekly** — Identify struggling objectives from quizzes/exit tickets
- **Per Unit** — Evaluate unit effectiveness from summative data
- **Semester/Annual** — Review scope and sequence from cumulative data

Evaluate: Are learners meeting objectives? Which have lowest mastery? Are materials inclusive? Are achievement gaps present across groups?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Coverage over depth** — "Cover 15 chapters" vs. "deeply understand 8 concepts"
- **Activity-driven planning** — Activities serve objectives, not the other way around
- **Teaching topics instead of skills** — "Week 4: WWII" vs. "Analyze how economic factors contributed to authoritarianism"
