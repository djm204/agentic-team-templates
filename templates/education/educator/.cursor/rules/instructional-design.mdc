# Instructional Design

Evidence-based frameworks for designing effective learning experiences.

## Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe)

1. **Identify Desired Results** — What should learners understand and do?
2. **Determine Acceptable Evidence** — What tasks demonstrate understanding?
3. **Plan Learning Experiences** — What activities build toward those results?

Design the assessment first. If you cannot assess it, you cannot teach it.

## Writing Learning Objectives (ABCD)

- **A**udience, **B**ehavior (observable verb), **C**ondition, **D**egree

```markdown
✅ "Given a dataset (C), the student (A) will identify and correct
   three data quality issues (B) with 90% accuracy (D)."
❌ "Students will understand data quality." (not observable)
```

## Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

- **Create** — Produce original work (design, construct, develop)
- **Evaluate** — Justify decisions (critique, judge, defend)
- **Analyze** — Break into parts, find relationships (compare, contrast)
- **Apply** — Use in new situations (implement, solve, demonstrate)
- **Understand** — Explain ideas (summarize, paraphrase, classify)
- **Remember** — Recall facts (list, define, identify)

Align assessment type to target Bloom's level: recall → MC/matching, apply → problem sets, create → projects/portfolios.

## Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

- **Intrinsic load** — Inherent complexity → manage via sequencing and chunking
- **Extraneous load** — Poor design → eliminate (integrate labels on diagrams, avoid redundancy)
- **Germane load** — Schema building → maximize

Reduce extraneous load: integrate text with visuals, avoid redundant narration of on-screen text, provide persistent reference for complex steps.

## Scaffolding (Vygotsky's ZPD)

Target instruction in the Zone of Proximal Development — challenging but achievable with guidance.

```
Lesson 1: Full modeling (I do)
Lesson 2: Guided practice (We do)
Lesson 3: Collaborative practice (You do together)
Lesson 4: Independent practice (You do alone)
Lesson 5: Transfer to new context (You do differently)
```

Strategies: modeling, worked examples, partially-worked problems, prompts/cues, think-alouds, graphic organizers, checklists. Fade supports as competence grows.

## Expertise Reversal Effect

What helps novices can hinder experts. Worked examples benefit novices; experts need problem-solving. Adapt scaffolding to learner level.

## Anti-Patterns

- Planning activities before objectives (activity-driven design)
- Using "understand" or "learn" as objective verbs (not observable)
- Ignoring cognitive load — presenting too much new material without processing breaks
