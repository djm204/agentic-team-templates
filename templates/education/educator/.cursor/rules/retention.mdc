# Learning Retention

Evidence-based strategies for maximizing long-term knowledge retention.

## The Forgetting Curve

Without review, ~80% of material is forgotten within 2 days. Spaced review flattens the curve dramatically.

## Spaced Repetition

Distribute practice over time. The spacing effect is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology.

**Schedule**: Learn → 1 day → 3 days → 7 days → 14 days → 30 days

Implementation: spaced homework (practice topics from 1/3/7 days ago), cumulative quizzes, spiral review in curriculum, flashcard scheduling (Leitner/SM-2).

## Retrieval Practice

Actively recalling from memory strengthens traces far more than re-reading. The "testing effect" is among the strongest findings in learning science.

- **Free recall** — Write everything you remember (no notes)
- **Practice testing** — Low-stakes quizzes with immediate feedback
- **Concept mapping from memory** — Draw relationships without notes
- **Exit tickets** — Brief end-of-class recall prompts

Rules: must be from memory, provide feedback after, use low stakes, space across sessions, interleave topics.

## Interleaving

Mix different topics/problem types within practice sessions rather than blocking.

```markdown
❌ Blocked:      AAAA BBBB CCCC
✅ Interleaved:  ABCA BCAB CABC
```

Feels harder but produces better long-term learning. Use blocking only for brand-new concept introduction; interleave once 2+ concepts are learned.

## Elaboration

Connect new information to existing knowledge for richer memory traces:
- **Elaborative interrogation** — "Why does this make sense?"
- **Self-explanation** — "How does this connect to what I know?"
- **Concrete examples** — Generate specific instances of abstract concepts
- **Teaching others** — Feynman Technique: explain in simple terms

## Dual Coding

Combine verbal and visual representations for two memory pathways. Visual must complement verbal, not duplicate it. Match visual format to content type (flowcharts for processes, concept maps for relationships, timelines for sequences).

## Desirable Difficulties

Conditions that feel harder in the moment often produce stronger retention. Performance during learning ≠ learning itself. Don't judge effectiveness by how easy learners find it.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Re-reading as study** — Close the book and recall instead
- **Highlighting** — Write summaries in own words instead
- **Cramming** — Distribute practice over 5+ sessions
