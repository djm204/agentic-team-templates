# Assessment Design

Evidence-based approaches to measuring learning and guiding instruction.

## Formative vs. Summative

- **Formative** — During learning, low-stakes, guides instruction (every 10-15 min)
- **Summative** — After learning, higher stakes, evaluates achievement

Formative techniques: exit tickets, think-pair-share, muddiest point, polling, fist-to-five, misconception checks.

## Rubric Design

- Share rubrics before the assessment — students should know the target
- Use descriptive language, not evaluative (describe what work looks like at each level)
- Limit criteria to 3-6 to avoid assessor overload
- Use consistent scale across criteria
- Involve learners in co-creation when appropriate

```markdown
❌ Vague: "Good use of evidence"
✅ Specific: "Integrates 3+ relevant sources with citations supporting each claim"
```

## Mastery-Based Progression

Learners advance when they demonstrate mastery (80-90% on core objectives), not when a calendar date arrives. Allow multiple attempts — learning from errors is the point.

- Criterion-referenced, not norm-referenced
- Must demonstrate on novel problems (not repeated items)

## Authentic Assessment

Assessments should mirror real-world tasks: construct responses (not just select), use real-world context, allow multiple valid approaches, target application and transfer.

## Writing Effective Items

- Stem should be a complete question
- All options plausible and parallel in structure/length
- Avoid "all of the above" / "none of the above"
- Test concepts and understanding, not trivia
- Equalize length across options

## Feedback Design

Effective feedback is:
- **Timely** — As close to performance as possible
- **Specific** — Points to exact elements
- **Actionable** — Tells the learner what to do next
- **Focused** — 2-3 points maximum per instance
- **Growth-oriented** — Focuses on work, not the person

```markdown
1. What was done well (specific)
2. What needs improvement (specific)
3. Next step (actionable)
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Grading without feedback (evaluation without learning)
- Single-attempt high-stakes assessments with no revision opportunity
- Assessing recall when the objective targets analysis or creation
