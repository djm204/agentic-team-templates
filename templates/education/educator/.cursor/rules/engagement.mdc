# Engagement and Motivation

Evidence-based strategies for sustaining learner engagement and intrinsic motivation.

## Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)

Three basic psychological needs drive intrinsic motivation:

- **Autonomy** — Offer meaningful choices, explain rationale, minimize controlling language
- **Competence** — Calibrate challenge to ZPD, provide specific feedback, celebrate growth
- **Relatedness** — Build community, show genuine interest, model vulnerability

Goal: move learners from external motivation ("I'll be punished") toward intrinsic ("I find this fascinating") over time.

## Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi)

Flow occurs when challenge ≈ skill level (both high). Create flow through:
- Clear goals and immediate feedback
- Challenge-skill balance (differentiate dynamically)
- Sense of control and choice
- Minimized distractions, focused work blocks
- Psychologically safe environment for mistakes

## Growth Mindset (Dweck)

```markdown
❌ "You're so smart!"           → ✅ "You worked really hard on that"
❌ "This is easy, you'll get it" → ✅ "This is challenging—that's how you grow"
```

Use **process praise** (effort, strategy, revision) not **person praise** (talent, intelligence). Person praise implies ability is fixed; failure threatens identity.

## Active Learning

Attention drops after ~10-15 minutes of passive input. Structure in cycles:

```
[10 min input] → [5 min active processing] → repeat
```

High-impact techniques: think-pair-share, jigsaw, case studies, problem-based learning, Socratic questioning, peer instruction, gallery walks.

## Gamification

**Effective elements**: XP/progress bars (cumulative progress), badges (mastery milestones), quests (narrative challenges), streaks (consistent practice).

**Anti-patterns**:
- Points for attendance (rewards presence, not learning)
- Competitive leaderboards as primary motivator
- Extrinsic rewards crowding out intrinsic motivation

## Flipped Classroom

Move passive input (video/reading) to home; use class time for active practice with instructor support. Pre-class videos <10 min with embedded questions. Start class with retrieval on pre-class material.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Entertainment vs. engagement** — Fun without cognitive investment isn't learning
- **Over-reliance on extrinsic rewards** — Can undermine intrinsic motivation (overjustification effect)
- **Participation ≠ learning** — Active hands ≠ active minds; verify with retrieval
