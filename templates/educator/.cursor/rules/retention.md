Without review, ~80% of material is forgotten within 2 days.
With spaced review, retention curves flatten dramatically.
```

## Spaced Repetition

### Principle

Distribute practice over time rather than massing it together. The spacing effect is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology.

### Optimal Spacing Schedule

```
Initial learning  → Review after 1 day
Review 1 (Day 1)  → Review after 3 days
Review 2 (Day 4)  → Review after 7 days
Review 3 (Day 11) → Review after 14 days
Review 4 (Day 25) → Review after 30 days
Review 5 (Day 55) → Long-term retention achieved
```

### Implementation Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Spaced homework | Assign practice on topics from 1, 3, and 7 days ago | K-12, structured courses |
| Cumulative quizzes | Each quiz includes items from all prior units | University courses |
| Spiral review | Revisit topics in expanding intervals throughout term | Curriculum design |
| Flashcard scheduling | Leitner system or SM-2 algorithm for card rotation | Self-directed study |

### Spacing in Course Design

```markdown
Week 1: Introduce Topic A
Week 2: Introduce Topic B, review Topic A
Week 3: Introduce Topic C, review Topics A & B
Week 4: Introduce Topic D, review Topics B & C
Week 5: Introduce Topic E, review Topics A, C & D (interleaved)
```

## Retrieval Practice

### Principle

Actively recalling information from memory strengthens the memory trace far more than re-reading or reviewing. The "testing effect" is one of the strongest findings in learning science.

### Retrieval Practice Techniques

| Technique | Description | Effort Level |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Free recall | Write everything you remember about a topic | High |
| Brain dump | Timed writing of all recalled information | High |
| Practice testing | Low-stakes quizzes with feedback | Medium |
| Flashcards | Active recall with spaced repetition | Medium |
| Concept mapping from memory | Draw relationships without notes | High |
| Think-pair-share | Recall → discuss → refine | Medium |
| Exit tickets | Brief end-of-class recall prompts | Low |

### Implementation Rules

```markdown
1. Retrieval must happen FROM MEMORY (no notes, no peeking)
2. Provide FEEDBACK after retrieval (correct misconceptions immediately)
3. Use LOW STAKES (practice, not grading—reduce anxiety)
4. Space retrieval across MULTIPLE sessions
5. Mix topics within a session (INTERLEAVE)
```

### Retrieval Practice Schedule

```
Lesson Start: 3-5 retrieval questions on prior material (not just yesterday)
Mid-Lesson: Brief recall check on today's new content
Lesson End: Exit ticket retrieving 2-3 key ideas from today
Next Lesson: Open with retrieval from today's content + older material
```

## Interleaving

### Principle

Mix different topics, problem types, or skills within a single practice session rather than blocking (practicing one type at a time).

```markdown
❌ Blocked Practice:     AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD
✅ Interleaved Practice: ABDC CABD DBCA ACDB
```

### Why Interleaving Works

- Forces **discrimination** between problem types
- Strengthens **retrieval** of appropriate strategies
- Builds **transfer** to novel situations
- Feels harder but produces better long-term learning

### When to Interleave vs. Block

| Use Blocking | Use Interleaving |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Brand new concept introduction | After initial learning of 2+ concepts |
| First exposure to a skill | Practicing distinguishing between skills |
| Building basic fluency | Building flexible application |
| Very beginning learners | Intermediate to advanced learners |

## Elaboration

### Principle

Connecting new information to existing knowledge creates richer, more retrievable memory traces.

### Elaboration Techniques

| Technique | Prompt | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Elaborative interrogation | "Why does this make sense?" | "Why would spaced practice improve retention?" |
| Self-explanation | "How does this connect to what I already know?" | "This reminds me of how muscles need rest between workouts" |
| Concrete examples | "What is a specific example of this concept?" | "Interleaving is like a musician practicing scales, arpeggios, and sight-reading in one session" |
| Dual coding | "How can I represent this visually AND verbally?" | Draw a diagram + write a summary |
| Teaching others | "How would I explain this to someone else?" | Feynman Technique: explain in simple terms |

## Dual Coding

### Principle

Combining verbal and visual representations creates two memory pathways, improving recall.

### Implementation

```markdown
For every key concept, provide:
1. A verbal explanation (text or narration)
2. A visual representation (diagram, chart, timeline, infographic)

Important: The visual must COMPLEMENT the verbal, not duplicate it.

❌ Wrong: Slide with bullet points read aloud verbatim
✅ Right: Diagram on screen with verbal explanation of relationships
```

### Effective Visual Types

| Content Type | Visual Format |
|-------------|---------------|
| Processes | Flowcharts, step diagrams |
| Relationships | Concept maps, Venn diagrams |
| Hierarchies | Tree diagrams, organizational charts |
| Timelines | Timeline graphics, Gantt-style charts |
| Comparisons | Tables, side-by-side layouts |
| Quantities | Bar charts, pie charts, infographics |
| Spatial | Maps, floor plans, anatomy diagrams |

## Desirable Difficulties

### Principle

Conditions that make learning feel harder in the moment often produce stronger long-term retention.

### Desirable vs. Undesirable Difficulties

| Desirable Difficulty | Undesirable Difficulty |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Spacing practice over time | Unclear instructions |
| Interleaving problem types | Illegible materials |
| Generating answers before seeing them | Content far beyond current ability |
| Varying practice conditions | Distracting learning environment |
| Reducing feedback frequency (after basics) | No feedback at all |

### Key Insight

```markdown
PERFORMANCE during learning ≠ LEARNING itself

High performance during practice (feels easy) → often poor retention
Lower performance during practice (feels hard) → often better retention

Implication: Do NOT judge instructional effectiveness by how easy
learners find the material during the session.
```

## Common Retention Pitfalls

### 1. Re-reading as Study Strategy

```markdown
❌ "Read chapter 5 again for review"
✅ "Close the book and write down everything you remember from chapter 5"
```

### 2. Highlighting as Deep Learning

```markdown
❌ Highlighting passages (creates illusion of learning)
✅ Writing summaries in own words after reading (requires processing)
```

### 3. Massed Practice Before Exams

```markdown
❌ Cramming the night before (high short-term, poor long-term)
✅ Distributed practice over 5+ sessions (lower per-session, higher long-term)
```

### 4. Fluency Illusion

```markdown
❌ "I can follow the solution, so I understand it"
✅ "Can I solve a similar problem from scratch without the solution?"
```

### 5. Skipping Feedback After Retrieval

```markdown
❌ Quiz with no answer review
✅ Quiz → immediate feedback → correction → re-test later
```
