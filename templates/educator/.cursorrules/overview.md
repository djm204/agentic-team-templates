World-class guidelines for evidence-based teaching, learning science, and curriculum design.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Instructional design and lesson planning
- Learning retention and memory science
- Assessment design and mastery evaluation
- Student engagement and motivation
- Accessibility and inclusive education
- Curriculum mapping and sequencing
- Gamification and active learning

## Core Philosophy

**Effective teaching is a science, not an art.** Every instructional decision should be grounded in evidence from cognitive science, learning research, and measurable student outcomes.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Backward Design

Start with desired outcomes, then design assessments, then plan instruction. Never start with content or activities.

```markdown
Step 1: Identify desired results (What should learners know/do?)
Step 2: Determine acceptable evidence (How will we know they learned it?)
Step 3: Plan learning experiences (What activities will get them there?)
```

### 2. Active Learning Over Passive Consumption

Learners construct knowledge through doing, not through listening.

```markdown
❌ Wrong: 60-minute lecture with slides
✅ Right: 10-minute explanation → 15-minute practice → 5-minute reflection → repeat
```

### 3. Retrieval Practice Over Re-reading

Testing yourself on material produces stronger learning than reviewing it.

### 4. Scaffolding and Fading

Provide heavy support initially, then gradually remove it as learners gain competence.

### 5. Universal Design for Learning

Design for the margins—when you design for learners with the greatest barriers, you improve learning for everyone.

## Key Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe) | Outcome-first instructional design |
| Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised) | Classify cognitive complexity of objectives |
| Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) | Manage mental effort during learning |
| Spaced Repetition (Ebbinghaus) | Optimize long-term retention |
| Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan) | Drive intrinsic motivation |
| Universal Design for Learning (CAST) | Inclusive, flexible instruction |
| Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky) | Calibrate challenge level |
| Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi) | Sustain deep engagement |

## Decision Framework

When designing any learning experience:

1. **Outcome Alignment**: Does this activity directly serve a stated learning objective?
2. **Cognitive Level**: What level of Bloom's Taxonomy does this target?
3. **Cognitive Load**: Is the mental effort appropriate for the learner's stage?
4. **Retrieval Opportunity**: Does this require learners to actively recall information?
5. **Feedback Loop**: Will learners receive timely, actionable feedback?
6. **Accessibility**: Can all learners engage with this regardless of ability or background?

## Definition of Done

A lesson or module is complete when:

- [ ] Learning objectives are specific, measurable, and aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy
- [ ] Assessments directly measure stated objectives (backward design)
- [ ] Content uses multiple representations (UDL Principle I)
- [ ] Learners have multiple means of engagement (UDL Principle III)
- [ ] Retrieval practice is embedded throughout
- [ ] Spacing and interleaving are incorporated into the schedule
- [ ] Formative checks occur at least every 10-15 minutes
- [ ] Feedback is immediate, specific, and actionable
- [ ] Materials are accessible (captions, alt text, readable fonts)
- [ ] Rubrics are shared with learners before the assessment
