# Assessment Design

Evidence-based approaches to measuring learning and guiding instruction.

## Assessment Types

### Formative vs. Summative

| Aspect | Formative | Summative |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Purpose | Guide instruction, identify gaps | Evaluate achievement |
| Timing | During learning | After learning |
| Stakes | Low (practice, not grading) | Higher (grading, certification) |
| Frequency | Continuous (every 10-15 min) | Periodic (end of unit/course) |
| Feedback | Immediate, specific, actionable | Evaluative, comparative |
| Analogy | GPS during the journey | Final destination photo |

### Formative Assessment Techniques

| Technique | Time | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Exit tickets | 2-3 min | Brief written response to a prompt at end of lesson |
| Think-pair-share | 3-5 min | Individual think → partner discuss → share with class |
| Muddiest point | 1-2 min | "What was most confusing today?" |
| One-minute paper | 1-2 min | "Summarize the most important idea from today" |
| Polling/clickers | 1 min | Real-time multiple choice with immediate data |
| Whiteboards | 2-3 min | All students display answers simultaneously |
| Fist-to-five | 30 sec | Self-assess confidence (0=lost, 5=mastered) |
| Misconception check | 2-3 min | Present common error; ask if correct and why |

### Summative Assessment Types

| Type | Best For | Bloom's Level |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Multiple choice | Recall, comprehension, discrimination | Remember–Analyze |
| Short answer | Recall, explanation, application | Remember–Apply |
| Essay | Analysis, evaluation, synthesis | Analyze–Create |
| Problem sets | Application, analysis | Apply–Analyze |
| Projects | Synthesis, creation, real-world transfer | Apply–Create |
| Portfolios | Growth over time, reflection, metacognition | All levels |
| Performances | Demonstration of skills in context | Apply–Create |
| Oral exams | Depth of understanding, reasoning process | Understand–Evaluate |

## Rubric Design

### Analytic vs. Holistic Rubrics

```markdown
Analytic Rubric: Scores each criterion separately
  → Use when: Detailed feedback needed, skills are independent
  → Example: Writing rubric (thesis, evidence, organization, grammar scored separately)

Holistic Rubric: Single overall score based on general impression
  → Use when: Quick scoring needed, overall quality matters more than components
  → Example: Art portfolio (overall artistic merit)
```

### Analytic Rubric Template

```markdown
| Criterion | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Criterion 1] | [Description of exemplary performance] | [Description of proficient performance] | [Description of developing performance] | [Description of beginning performance] |
| [Criterion 2] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |
| [Criterion 3] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |
```

### Rubric Best Practices

1. **Share rubrics before the assessment** — students should know the target
2. **Use descriptive language, not evaluative** — describe what the work looks like at each level
3. **Include examples** — anchor each level with sample work
4. **Limit criteria to 3-6** — more than 6 creates cognitive overload for assessors
5. **Use consistent scale** — same number of levels across criteria
6. **Involve learners** — co-create rubrics when appropriate

### Writing Rubric Descriptors

```markdown
❌ Vague: "Good use of evidence"
✅ Specific: "Integrates 3+ relevant sources with proper citations,
    using evidence to directly support each claim in the argument"

❌ Comparative: "Better than average analysis"
✅ Absolute: "Identifies the underlying assumptions in the argument
    and evaluates their validity using logical reasoning"
```

## Mastery-Based Progression

### Principle

Learners advance when they demonstrate mastery of objectives, not when a calendar date arrives.

### Mastery Learning Model (Bloom)

```
Instruction → Formative Assessment → Mastery?
                                        │
                              ┌─────────┴──────────┐
                              ▼                     ▼
                          Yes: Advance          No: Corrective
                          to next unit          instruction →
                                                Re-assess →
                                                Loop until mastery
```

### Mastery Criteria

```markdown
Define mastery BEFORE instruction:
- Criterion-referenced (not norm-referenced)
- Typically 80-90% accuracy on core objectives
- Must demonstrate on novel problems (not repeated items)
- Allow multiple attempts (learning from errors is the point)
```

### Mastery Gradebook

| Objective | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 | Attempt 3 | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Identify logical fallacies | 60% | 75% | 90% | Mastered |
| Construct valid arguments | 70% | 85% | — | Mastered |
| Evaluate source credibility | 55% | 65% | 70% | In Progress |

## Authentic Assessment

### Principle

Assessments should mirror real-world tasks that professionals or citizens actually perform.

### Authentic vs. Traditional

| Traditional | Authentic |
|-------------|-----------|
| Select a response | Construct a response |
| Contrived context | Real-world context |
| Recall/recognition | Application/transfer |
| Teacher as sole audience | Authentic audience |
| Single correct answer | Multiple valid approaches |
| One-time event | Ongoing process |

### Authentic Assessment Examples

| Subject | Traditional | Authentic |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Science | Multiple choice on lab procedures | Design and conduct an experiment |
| Writing | Grammar worksheet | Write a letter to the editor about a local issue |
| Math | Solve textbook problems | Create a budget for a community event |
| History | Memorize dates and events | Analyze primary sources to argue a historical thesis |
| Programming | Syntax quiz | Build a working application that solves a user need |

## Writing Effective Test Items

### Multiple Choice Best Practices

```markdown
✅ Good Item:
  Stem: "Which of the following best explains why spaced practice
         improves long-term retention?"
  A) It reduces the total amount of study time needed
  B) It forces repeated retrieval from long-term memory  ← correct
  C) It allows students to re-read material more times
  D) It groups similar topics for efficient review

✅ Why it's good:
  - Stem is a complete question
  - All options are plausible
  - No "all of the above" or "none of the above"
  - Tests understanding, not just recall
  - Options are parallel in structure and length
```

### Common Item-Writing Errors

| Error | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Stem clue | "An unbiased sample is one that is NOT..." | Rephrase positively |
| Longest correct answer | Correct option has 3x the detail of distractors | Equalize length |
| Absolute terms | "always," "never" in distractors | Use qualified language |
| "All of the above" | Guessing 2 correct implies all correct | Remove; use select-all |
| Trivial content | "What year was X published?" | Test concepts, not trivia |
| Grammatical cue | "An ___" eliminates options starting with consonants | Check grammar |

## Feedback Design

### Effective Feedback Principles

1. **Timely** — as close to the performance as possible
2. **Specific** — points to exact elements, not just "good job"
3. **Actionable** — tells the learner what to do next
4. **Focused** — 2-3 points maximum per feedback instance
5. **Growth-oriented** — focuses on the work, not the person

### Feedback Framework

```markdown
1. What was done well (specific): "Your thesis statement clearly
   states a debatable claim supported by your three main arguments."

2. What needs improvement (specific): "The second body paragraph
   presents evidence but doesn't explain how it supports your thesis."

3. Next step (actionable): "Add 2-3 sentences after each piece of
   evidence explaining the connection to your central argument."
```

### Feedback Timing

| When | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Immediate | Correct/incorrect with explanation | Factual knowledge, procedures |
| Delayed (hours) | Detailed written feedback | Complex tasks, essays, projects |
| Self-paced | Model answers for self-comparison | Building self-assessment skills |
| Peer | Structured peer review with rubric | Developing evaluative judgment |
