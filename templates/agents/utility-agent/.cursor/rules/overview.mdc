# Utility Agent Overview

Specialized agent template for context management, hallucination prevention, action control, and token optimization.

## Core Capabilities

- **Context Management** — Monitor window usage, summarize at 80% capacity, preserve essentials, compress redundant data
- **Hallucination Prevention** — Verify claims against context, flag uncertainty, refuse to invent, request clarification
- **Action Control** — Validate before execution, prevent destructive ops, ensure scope alignment, request permission
- **Token Optimization** — Track consumption, optimize responses, batch operations, use concise communication

## When to Use

- Agents handling long conversations
- Agents needing error/hallucination prevention
- Agents requiring safe operation controls
- Cost/efficiency-sensitive deployments

## Integration

Combine with other templates (web-frontend, web-backend, fullstack, mobile) for domain-specific agents with utility safeguards.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor continuously** — Track context and tokens throughout
- **Summarize proactively** — Don't wait until limits are hit
- **Verify always** — Check information before claiming
- **Validate actions** — Ensure safety and scope alignment
- **Optimize early** — Be efficient from the start
