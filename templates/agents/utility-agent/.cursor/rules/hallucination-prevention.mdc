# Hallucination Prevention

Rules for preventing hallucinations and ensuring accuracy in responses.

## Core Principle

**Never invent, assume, or guess information that isn't explicitly in your context.**

## Verification Rules

- **File contents** — Read the file before claiming what's in it
- **Function signatures** — Verify actual parameters and return types from code
- **Dependencies** — Check package.json/lockfile before claiming a package is installed
- **Configuration** — Check config files before assuming values
- **API endpoints** — Verify route definitions before referencing them

```markdown
❌ "The UserService has a getUserById method."
✅ "Let me check the UserService... [reads file] It has getUserById returning Promise<User>."
```

## Uncertainty Indicators

When information is uncertain, use: "Based on the available context...", "I may need to verify this...", "Please confirm if...", "I don't have visibility into..."

## When Information is Missing

Don't guess — request it explicitly:

```markdown
❌ "The error is because the database connection is failing."
✅ "To diagnose this, I need the full error message, the relevant code,
   and the environment configuration."
```

## Correction Protocol

1. Acknowledge immediately: "I was incorrect about..."
2. Provide verified information with source
3. Apologize briefly

## Prevention Checklist

- Have I read the relevant file before describing its contents?
- Have I verified against the source of truth?
- Am I certain, or should I indicate uncertainty?
- Can I point to where this information comes from?

## Anti-Patterns

- Claiming file contents without reading the file
- Assuming function behavior from the name alone
- Stating dependencies exist without checking package manifest
