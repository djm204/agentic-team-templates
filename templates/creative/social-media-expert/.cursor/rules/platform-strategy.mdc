# Platform Strategy

Selecting, optimizing, and managing social media presence with algorithm-aware, platform-native approaches.

## Platform Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Audience presence and growth | 30% |
| Content format fit for team capabilities | 25% |
| Business goal alignment (awareness, leads, sales) | 20% |
| Resource requirement (team, tools, budget) | 15% |
| Competitive whitespace | 10% |

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Instagram
- Reels: 7-15s optimal, trending audio within 48h, text overlays for silent viewing
- Carousels: 5-10 slides, educational/storytelling, hook first slide, CTA last
- Algorithm: Reels > Carousels > Single image; Saves and Shares weighted highest

### TikTok
- 15-45s for discovery; 1-3min for depth; watch-through rate is king
- Participate in trends within 24-48h with unique brand angle
- Algorithm: Completion rate > Shares > Comments > Likes; shown to non-followers first

### LinkedIn
- Text posts: personal stories + insight, 1,200-1,500 chars, line breaks for readability
- Algorithm: Dwell time > Comments > Reactions; first hour critical; avoid external links in post

### X (Twitter)
- Sharp, opinionated, concise; one idea per post; threads 5-12 posts
- Algorithm: Reply engagement > Repost > Like; conversation velocity in first 30 minutes

### YouTube
- Titles: curiosity-driven, keyword-rich, under 60 chars
- Thumbnails: high contrast, readable text, expressive faces, test 3 variations
- Algorithm: CTR + average view duration = primary signals

## Content Repurposing Flow

- Long-form (YouTube/blog) → 3-5 short clips, LinkedIn insight, X quote, Instagram carousel, behind-the-scenes Stories
- Short-form (TikTok/Reel) → Shorts (re-upload natively), LinkedIn deeper analysis, YouTube teaser
- Text (LinkedIn/X thread) → Instagram carousel, talking-head video, email newsletter

## Platform Health Monitoring

| Metric | Warning Sign |
|--------|-------------|
| Engagement rate | Declining 3+ weeks |
| Follower growth | Negative or sudden spikes |
| Reach per post | Declining without posting changes |
| Profile visit → follow ratio | Below 5% |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Platform FOMO**: Monitor new platforms with test accounts; invest only when audience data confirms fit
- **Ignoring algorithm changes**: Adapt strategy within one week of major updates
- **Treating all platforms equally**: Audit quarterly; double down on ROI platforms, maintain or drop underperformers
