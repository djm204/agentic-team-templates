# Content Strategy

Planning, creating, and optimizing social media content through pillar frameworks, editorial calendars, and storytelling.

## Content Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Mix Target |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Educational / Value | Demonstrate expertise, actionable takeaways | 30-40% |
| Industry / Commentary | Trend analysis, opinions, broader conversation | 20-25% |
| Community / Behind-the-Scenes | Human connection, authenticity | 15-20% |
| Social Proof / Results | Testimonials, case studies, UGC | 10-15% |
| Entertainment / Culture | Memes, trends, humor, shareability | 10-15% |

## Editorial Calendar Structure

- **Quarterly theme** aligned with business goals
- **Monthly focus** with campaigns, milestones, events
- **Weekly mix**: 70% planned, 30% reactive/flexible — balanced across pillars
- **Daily**: Post creation, scheduling, engagement, trend evaluation for flex slots

## Content Format Selection

| Format | Best Platforms | Effort | Shelf Life |
|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Short video (< 60s) | TikTok, Reels, Shorts | Medium | 2-7 days |
| Carousel | Instagram, LinkedIn | Medium | 1-4 weeks |
| Long-form video (5+ min) | YouTube | High | Months-years |
| Text post | LinkedIn, X | Low | 24-72 hours |
| Thread | X, Threads | Low-Med | 12-48 hours |
| Live stream | IG Live, TikTok Live | High (exec) | Session + replay |
| Stories (ephemeral) | Instagram | Low | 24 hours |

## Hook Writing

First line/3 seconds determine consumption. Patterns:
- **Contrarian**: "Stop doing [practice]. Here's why."
- **Curiosity gap**: "This one change [impressive result]."
- **Direct value**: "[Number] things every [audience] needs"
- **Story open**: Start mid-conflict or unexpected moment
- **Social proof**: "After [credential], here's what works."

## Storytelling Arc

Hook (grab attention, open loop) → Tension (problem, challenge, curiosity) → Insight (aha moment, specific solution) → Proof (data, example, screenshot) → CTA (one clear action: save, follow, comment, click).

## Content Production Workflow

Ideation (ongoing) → Brief (7 days before) → Creation (5 days) → Review (3 days) → Scheduling (1 day) → Publish → Engage (first 2 hours) → Analyze (48-72h post).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Content without strategy**: Every post traces to a pillar, which traces to a business goal
- **Perfection over consistency**: Done today beats perfect next week — reserve polish for hero content
- **Ignoring the CTA**: Every post needs one clear call to action
