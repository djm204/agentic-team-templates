# Community Management

Managing social media communities, moderating conversations, monitoring sentiment, and handling crisis communication.

## Community Maturity Model

1. **Audience** (passive): People see content but don't interact → create content worth stopping for
2. **Followers** (interested): Occasional engagement → respond to every interaction
3. **Community** (active): Regular engagement with each other → facilitate member-to-member conversation
4. **Advocates** (invested): Create content about you unprompted → amplify and reward loyalty
5. **Ambassadors** (aligned): Identify with and defend brand → formalize relationships, exclusive access

## Response Protocol

| Interaction Type | Response Window | Approach |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Positive comment | 1 hour | Genuine acknowledgment, follow-up question |
| Simple question | 2 hours | Accurate answer, link to resources |
| Mild complaint | 1 hour | Empathize, offer solution |
| Serious complaint | 30 minutes | Empathize, take to DM, connect support |
| Negative brand mention | 1 hour | Assess severity, correct if factual error |
| Troll / bad faith | Do not engage | Hide, delete, or block per policy |
| Influencer mention | 30 minutes | Warm, personal response |

## Moderation Policy

- **Spam**: Delete, block repeat offenders
- **Directed profanity/hate speech**: Delete, warn or ban, report to platform
- **Misinformation about brand**: Respond publicly with factual correction
- **Threats/doxxing**: Delete, ban, report, escalate to legal
- **Off-topic but harmless**: Redirect gently or leave visible

## Sentiment Monitoring

Track in real-time: brand mentions, product mentions, campaign hashtags, competitor mentions. Analyze weekly: sentiment ratio (positive:neutral:negative), trends, platform comparison.

**Escalation thresholds**: 25%+ negative spike in 24h, single post exceeds 100 engagements or 10K views, media amplification, multi-platform spread.

## Crisis Communication Protocol

| Severity | Response Time | Actions |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Level 1 (Minor) | 2-4 hours | Community manager responds, corrects, monitors |
| Level 2 (Moderate) | 1 hour | Social lead + PR coordinate response |
| Level 3 (Serious) | 30 minutes | War room: pause content, draft public statement |
| Level 4 (Emergency) | 15 minutes | CEO involved, legal review, continuous management |

Crisis sequence: Pause all scheduled content → Acknowledge ("We are aware and investigating") → Respond with full statement → Manage ongoing → Recover with follow-up and retrospective.

## Community Health Metrics

| Metric | Healthy | Warning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Response time | Under 2 hours | Over 4 hours |
| Sentiment ratio | 70%+ positive, <10% negative | Negative >20% |
| Repeat engager count | Growing MoM | Declining |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Deleting all negativity**: Leave constructive criticism visible; respond with empathy — only delete policy violations
- **Template responses**: Personalize — reference specific content, use names
- **Ignoring DMs**: DMs contain most engaged followers and partnership opportunities
