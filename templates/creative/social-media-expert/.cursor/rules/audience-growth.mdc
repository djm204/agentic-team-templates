# Audience Growth

Building and expanding social media audiences through organic tactics, collaboration, paid amplification, and profile optimization.

## Growth Strategy Phases

- **Foundation (Mo 1-3)**: Optimize profiles, establish pillars and cadence, respond to every comment
- **Acceleration (Mo 3-6)**: Increase frequency on best platform, launch collaborations, experiment with trending formats
- **Scaling (Mo 6-12)**: Double down on winning formats/platforms, introduce paid amplification, build influencer pipeline
- **Sustaining (12+)**: Maintain cadence, develop community advocates, diversify platforms to reduce risk

## Organic Growth Tactics

| Tactic | Impact | Effort |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Consistent posting at platform cadence | Foundation — algorithm rewards reliability | Medium (ongoing) |
| Reply to every comment within 1 hour | Community loyalty + algorithm signal | Medium (daily) |
| Trend participation within 24-48h | Spikes in reach and discovery | Medium (reactive) |
| Hashtag optimization (rotate every 2-4 weeks) | Expands discovery | Low |
| Collaboration posts with complementary accounts | Exposes brand to partner audience | Medium-High |
| SEO for social (keyword-rich bios, captions, alt text) | Growing discovery factor | Low |
| Content series (recurring format) | Builds habit and return viewership | Medium |

## Collaboration Strategy

- **Collab posts**: Joint post on both feeds — partner should have similar/larger audience
- **Guest appearances**: Podcast, video, or Live — prepare unique value
- **Content swap**: Each creates content for other's audience — align on quality
- **Joint Live/Spaces**: Co-host on shared topic — promote 48h in advance

## Profile Optimization

- Username consistent across platforms; short, memorable, searchable
- Bio line 1: value proposition (what you do for whom); line 2: proof/credential; line 3: CTA
- Profile photo recognizable at 40x40px; banner updated quarterly
- Link in bio tracked with UTMs; pinned content refreshed monthly

## Follower Quality Assessment

| Indicator | Healthy | Unhealthy |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Engagement rate | Grows with followers | Drops as followers increase |
| Comment quality | Specific, genuine | Generic, bot-like |
| Demographics | Match target audience | Mismatched geography/interests |
| Unfollow rate | Below 1% weekly | Spikes after giveaways |

## Paid Amplification

- Promote top organic content to lookalike audiences ($10-50/day, 2-week tests)
- Boost posts with 2x+ average engagement (10-15% of social budget)
- Retarget website visitors and video viewers (highest conversion rate)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Follow-for-follow / engagement pods**: Build genuine audience — fake signals confuse algorithms
- **Giveaway-driven growth**: Tie giveaways to genuine engagement, not just follows
- **Ignoring existing followers**: Retention is cheaper than acquisition — prioritize community health alongside growth
