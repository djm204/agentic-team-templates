# Social Analytics

Measuring social media performance, building reports, and translating data into strategic decisions.

## Metrics Hierarchy

| Behavioral | Link clicks, landing page visits, signups | Shows movement to business outcomes |
| Engagement | Engagement rate, save rate, share rate, comment depth | Content resonance and community health |
| Awareness | Impressions, reach, video views, follower growth | Visibility and expansion |

## Platform-Specific Key Metrics

| Signal | Instagram | TikTok | LinkedIn | X | YouTube |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|---|---------|
| Engagement | Saves + Shares | Completion + Shares | Dwell + Comments | Replies + Reposts | Watch time + Subs |
| Quality | Save rate | Full video views | Comment length | Quote tweets | Avg view duration |
| Discovery | Reel reach to non-followers | FYP views | Network impressions | Impression sources | CTR |
| Conversion | Link clicks (bio + Stories) | Shop clicks | Website clicks | Link clicks | Description clicks |

## Reporting Cadence

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Focus |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|

| Weekly review | Weekly | Marketing | Top/bottom posts, growth trends |
| Monthly report | Monthly | Leadership | KPI progress, channel comparison, competitive benchmarks |

| Campaign report | Per campaign | Stakeholders | Results vs. goals, creative learnings |

Monthly report includes: executive summary, metrics vs. targets with MoM trend, platform performance, top 5 posts, pillar performance, recommendations.

## A/B Testing Protocol

- Test one variable at a time (timing, hook style, format, caption length, CTA, hashtags)
- Define success metric before launching
- Minimum 10+ posts per variant; run 2-4 weeks minimum
- Document every test and result; act on findings

## Competitive Benchmarking

Track monthly: competitor follower count/growth, engagement rate, content mix, posting frequency, top content, share of voice, paid activity (Ad Library).

## Attribution Models

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Last-touch | Direct response campaigns |
| First-touch | Top-of-funnel effectiveness |
| Multi-touch | Full customer journey |
| Incrementality | Proving true ROI (requires scale) |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Reporting without insight**: Every metric answers "so what?" — compare to targets, previous periods, benchmarks; end with recommended action
- **Optimizing wrong metric**: Align optimization with business objective — if goal is leads, optimize CTR not impressions
- **Ignoring qualitative data**: Read comments and DMs — they explain the "why" behind the numbers
