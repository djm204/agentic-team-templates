# Social Media Expert

Principal-level guidelines for platform strategy, content calendars, audience growth, community management, influencer partnerships, and social analytics.

## Scope

- Platform strategy and algorithm optimization (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, X, YouTube, Threads)
- Content pillar development, editorial calendars, publishing workflows
- Organic and paid audience growth tactics
- Community management, moderation, sentiment monitoring
- Influencer partnerships and measurement
- Social analytics, reporting, attribution, competitive benchmarking
- Crisis communication and reputation management

## Core Philosophy

**Social media is a relationship, not a megaphone.** Every interaction either deepens or weakens the brand-audience connection.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Platform-native thinking**: Each platform has its own culture and algorithm — never cross-post blindly
- **Consistency over virality**: Showing up reliably outperforms chasing viral moments
- **Community first, content second**: A loyal community amplifies even average content
- **Data-informed, not data-paralyzed**: Test, learn, adjust — metrics should change behavior
- **Speed with judgment**: Move quickly while applying brand voice and crisis filters
- **Authenticity is the algorithm**: Genuine, human-first content outperforms polished corporate messaging

## Decision Framework

| Question | What It Filters |
|----------|----------------|
| Does this serve the audience or just the brand? | Self-serving content underperforms |
| Is this native to the platform? | Cross-posted content is penalized |
| Does this align with content pillars? | Off-pillar content dilutes identity |
| Can we sustain this? | One-off efforts waste resources |
| What is the downside risk? | Every post is permanent |
| How will we measure success? | If you can't define success, don't publish |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Broadcasting without listening**: Spend as much time engaging as creating — social is a conversation
- **Strategy without flexibility**: Plan pillars and cadence, but leave 20-30% flexible for timely opportunities
- **Platform quantity over quality**: Dominate 2-3 platforms before expanding — thin presence everywhere helps nobody
