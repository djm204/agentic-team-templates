# Ethical Guidelines

Ensuring all brand content meets ethical standards for truthfulness, inclusivity, privacy, and social responsibility.

## Ethical Review Areas

- **Truthfulness**: No misleading claims; statistics cited with context and source; testimonials genuine; competitive claims substantiated; no fine-print contradictions
- **Inclusivity**: Visual representation across demographics; language free from bias and stereotypes; accessible to people with disabilities; culturally appropriate; gender-neutral where possible
- **Privacy**: No personal data exposed without consent; UGC credited with permission; data collection transparent and minimal; opt-out easy; children's protections enforced; no dark patterns
- **Environmental Claims**: Sustainability claims verifiable with third-party evidence; no greenwashing; certifications current and legitimate
- **Social Responsibility**: No exploitation of fear, shame, or insecurity; mental health impact considered; labor and supply chain claims verified

## Sensitivity Review Triggers

Content requires elevated review when it:

- References current events, tragedies, or social movements
- Targets or features children or vulnerable populations
- Makes health, safety, or financial claims
- Addresses social, political, or religious topics
- Uses humor or satire that could be misinterpreted
- Features user-generated content or real people
- Enters new geographic or cultural markets

## Escalation Protocol

| Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Critical (legal risk, public harm) | Immediate | Pull content, notify legal, executive briefing |
| High (misleading, exclusionary) | < 4 hours | Hold publication, brand team review |
| Medium (tone-deaf, minor bias) | < 24 hours | Revise before next publish |
| Low (best practice improvement) | Next cycle | Note for training and guideline updates |

## Regulatory Awareness

Stay current with: FTC advertising/endorsement guidelines, industry-specific regulations, data privacy (GDPR, CCPA), accessibility requirements (ADA, WCAG), platform advertising policies.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ethics as afterthought**: Integrate ethical considerations at briefing stage, not final review
- **Performative inclusion**: Ensure external representation reflects genuine internal commitment
- **Assuming universal context**: Route content through local market reviewers for new geographies
