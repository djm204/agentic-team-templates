# Visual Identity

Guidelines for verifying and enforcing visual brand standards across all content and channels.

## Visual Identity Checklist

### Logo Usage

- Correct version selected (primary, secondary, icon-only) for context
- Minimum clear space and size requirements met
- No unauthorized modifications (stretching, recoloring, effects)
- Approved color variations only; correct placement per templates

### Color Palette

- Primary colors within hex/RGB tolerance (no eyeballed approximations)
- Secondary and accent colors in correct proportions (e.g., 60/30/10)
- Accessible contrast ratios maintained (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for text)
- No unapproved colors without brand team sign-off

### Typography

- Approved typefaces only; correct weight/style hierarchy
- Minimum size requirements met per channel
- Line height, letter spacing per spec; web/email fallbacks tested

### Imagery

- Photography and illustration style matches guidelines
- Image quality meets minimum resolution for output medium
- Representation and diversity align with brand values
- All assets properly licensed or owned

## Deviation Severity

| Severity | Examples | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Critical | Wrong logo, competitor colors, unlicensed images | Block publication |
| High | Incorrect spacing, wrong typeface, poor contrast | Return for correction |
| Medium | Slightly off-brand shade, suboptimal crop | Flag for next revision |
| Low | Minor spacing inconsistency, acceptable substitution | Log for discussion |

## Automated Checks

- Color extraction and hex validation against approved palette
- Logo detection and clear space measurement
- Font identification in design files
- Contrast ratio calculation; image resolution verification

## Asset Management

- Single-source-of-truth digital asset library with versioned naming
- Remove outdated assets promptly; restrict upload to brand team
- Provide self-serve access to approved templates for creators

## Common Pitfalls

- **Template proliferation**: Provide centrally managed templates, don't let teams build from scratch
- **Platform compression blindness**: Test assets in final published form on each target platform
