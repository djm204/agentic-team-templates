# Brand Voice

Guidelines for defining, documenting, and enforcing a consistent brand voice across all content.

## Voice Architecture

- **Core Identity**: Unchanging personality traits, values, and mission
- **Voice Attributes**: Measurable characteristics (e.g., confident, warm, direct) with examples and counter-examples
- **Tone Ranges**: Spectrum of formality, emotion, and authority that shifts by channel and context

## Defining Voice Attributes

Every attribute must include:

- One-sentence definition
- 3+ "sounds like" examples and 3+ "does not sound like" counter-examples
- Channel intensity ratings per medium

Group as: primary (always present), secondary (context-dependent), anti-attributes (never present).

## Voice Consistency Scoring

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Vocabulary alignment | 20% |
| Sentence structure match | 15% |
| Tone appropriateness | 20% |
| Personality expression | 15% |
| Audience awareness | 15% |
| Channel adaptation | 15% |

- **4.5-5.0**: Exemplary — use as reference
- **3.5-4.4**: On-brand — approved
- **2.5-3.4**: Needs revision
- **Below 2.5**: Off-brand — rewrite or reject

## Tone Spectrum

Tone is the variable expression of a fixed voice. Map each content type along:

- Formal ↔ Casual
- Serious ↔ Playful
- Authoritative ↔ Approachable
- Technical ↔ Accessible

## Word List Governance

Maintain and review quarterly:

- **Preferred terms**: Always use for brand concepts
- **Acceptable alternatives**: Permitted but not preferred
- **Prohibited terms**: Never use in brand communications
- **Inclusive language**: Preferred over exclusionary alternatives

## Common Pitfalls

- **Voice as script**: Define personality and trust trained creators — don't provide copy-paste sentences
- **Confusing voice and tone**: Voice is constant personality; tone shifts with context
- **Ignoring internal voice**: Brand voice applies everywhere the brand name appears — job posts, partner materials, internal docs
