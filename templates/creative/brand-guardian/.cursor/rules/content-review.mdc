# Content Review

Guidelines for structured content review workflows, approval gates, and quality assurance.

## Review Tier System

| Tier | Content Types | Review Process |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 (Low) | Internal comms, social replies, routine emails | Creator self-check |
| Tier 2 (Medium) | Blog posts, social campaigns, email campaigns | One brand team member |
| Tier 3 (High) | Advertising, press releases, website updates | Brand manager + legal |
| Tier 4 (Critical) | Crisis comms, partnerships, major launches | Brand lead + executive + legal |

## Review Checklist Categories

- **Voice & Tone**: Matches brand attributes, appropriate channel tone, approved vocabulary, no prohibited terms
- **Visual Identity**: Logo, color, typography, imagery compliant with standards
- **Messaging**: Value proposition clear, key messages aligned, CTAs consistent, claims verified
- **Compliance**: Legal disclaimers, regulatory requirements, privacy, accessibility, cultural sensitivity
- **Technical Quality**: Grammar correct, links functional, metadata complete, format correct for platform

## Turnaround SLAs

| Tier | Maximum Turnaround | Escalation Contact |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Immediate (self-serve) | N/A |
| Tier 2 | 4 business hours | Brand manager |
| Tier 3 | 1 business day | Brand director |
| Tier 4 | 2 business days | CMO / executive sponsor |

## Feedback Standards

- **Specific**: Reference exact text or visual elements
- **Actionable**: Explain what to change and why
- **Prioritized**: Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-have
- **Constructive**: Frame as brand alignment, not personal preference

## Common Pitfalls

- **Review theater**: If review can't be thorough within SLA, escalate — don't rubber-stamp
- **Scope creep**: Brand review evaluates compliance, not creative direction
- **Missing the forest**: Include a holistic "gut check" — would a loyal customer recognize this as our brand?
