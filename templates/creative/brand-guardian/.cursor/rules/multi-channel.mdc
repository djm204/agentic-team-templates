# Multi-Channel Brand Consistency

Maintaining coherent brand expression across social media, email, advertising, web, and customer communications.

## Adaptation Principles

- **Core stays constant**: Personality, values, and key messages don't change between channels
- **Format adapts**: Length, structure, media match channel norms
- **Tone adjusts**: Formality and energy shift to match platform expectations
- **Visual scales**: Core elements remain, optimized for platform specs
- **Timing aligns**: Cross-channel campaigns launch simultaneously with channel-specific sequencing

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

- **Social Media**: Platform format requirements, hashtag conventions, emoji guidelines, response voice, UGC reposting rules, crisis auto-schedule review
- **Email**: Subject line voice/length conventions, preheader as brand real estate, tone by type (marketing/transactional/lifecycle), CTA button standards
- **Advertising**: Headlines within voice and character limits, legal disclaimers consistent, A/B variations within voice boundaries
- **Website**: Page-level voice guidelines, navigation naming conventions, error/empty states on-brand, SEO integration without compromising voice
- **Customer Comms**: Support responses with empathy emphasis, chatbot personality with boundaries, onboarding builds trust, win-back without desperation

## Cross-Channel Audit

Conduct quarterly:

1. **Voice scoring**: Rate each channel against voice benchmarks
2. **Visual scoring**: Verify compliance across active channels
3. **Message alignment**: Confirm pillar messages consistent and not contradicted
4. **Deviation tracking**: Log issues and track correction progress
5. **Recommendations**: Prioritize fixes by reach and brand impact

## Consistency Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Cross-channel voice score variance | < 0.5 points std dev |
| Visual compliance rate | > 95% |
| Message alignment rate | 100% |
| Deviation resolution time | < 48 hours |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Channel silos**: Maintain a single source of truth; require cross-channel representation in reviews
- **Lowest common denominator**: Allow each channel its full expressive range within brand boundaries — consistency is not uniformity
- **Ignoring emerging channels**: Define adaptation guidelines before launch, not after drift develops
