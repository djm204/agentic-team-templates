# Editorial Operations

Frameworks for content workflows, quality assurance, style governance, taxonomy, and lifecycle management at scale.

## Core Principle

**Repeatable processes produce consistent quality.** Systems, not heroics, sustain quality at scale.

## Content Workflow

Ideate → Brief → Draft → Review → Publish → Distribute → Measure → Update

| Gate | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Ideation → Brief | Topic validated against strategy | Brief completed and approved |
| Brief → Draft | Brief signed off with deadline | First draft with citations |
| Draft → Review | Draft meets outline and word count | All edit passes complete |
| Review → Publish | Legal and brand checks passed | Published with metadata |

## Four-Pass Editing

| Pass | Focus | Key Questions |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Structural | Organization | Logical flow? Balanced sections? |
| Substantive | Depth/accuracy | Claims supported? Examples specific? |
| Line Edit | Clarity/style | Every sentence necessary? Active voice? |
| Proof | Correctness | Spelling, grammar, links, formatting? |

## Style Guide Components

| Component | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice and tone | Personality, tone-by-context matrix |
| Grammar/mechanics | Oxford comma, numbers, capitalization |
| Formatting | Heading hierarchy, list styles, image specs |
| Terminology | Approved/banned terms, product naming |
| Accessibility | Alt text, heading structure, readability |
| Legal | Disclaimers, disclosures, trademark usage |

## Content Taxonomy

Classify every piece by: content type, topic pillar, funnel stage (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU), audience segment, lifecycle status (draft/in-review/published/needs-refresh/archived). Tag with controlled vocabulary — exactly one primary topic, 1-3 secondary topics.

## Content Audit and Lifecycle

| Audit Type | Cadence | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Performance review (top 50 pages) | Monthly | Optimization recommendations |
| Freshness audit (> 6 months old) | Quarterly | Refresh, consolidate, or archive list |
| Full inventory | Annually | Complete catalog with scores |

Scoring: traffic (25%), engagement (20%), conversions (25%), SEO position (15%), freshness (15%).

Actions: high performers → optimize and repurpose; moderate → refresh within 30 days; low → consolidate or redirect within 60 days; no value → archive with 301 redirect.

## Common Pitfalls

- **No style guide**: Inconsistency erodes brand trust
- **Single-pass editing**: Catching only typos, missing structural issues
- **Taxonomy neglect**: Content tagged inconsistently; impossible to audit
