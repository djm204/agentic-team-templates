# Content Strategy

Planning, aligning, and governing content programs that connect audience needs to business objectives.

## Core Principle

**Every piece answers three questions before production: Who is it for? What should they do after? How will we measure success?**

## Audience Research

Segment by: role, buying stage, sophistication level, motivation, objections, preferred format. Build personas from observed behavior — not assumptions — with goals, pain points, content preferences, and trigger events.

## Content Pillar Development

Select pillars by evaluating:

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Audience demand | High |
| Business relevance | High |
| Competitive gap | Medium |
| Internal expertise | Medium |
| Longevity | Medium |

Validate content-market fit: identify pain points from sales/support, map to topics, assess competition, validate with keyword data, pilot with minimum viable content, measure before investing in long-form.

## Editorial Calendar

- **Quarterly themes** aligned to business objectives
- **Monthly focus areas** with campaign and product milestones
- **Weekly content slots**: 70% planned, 30% reactive/flexible
- **Content mix**: TOFU 50-60%, MOFU 25-35%, BOFU 10-20%

## Content Governance

| Domain | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|
| Brand voice | Editorial review gate |
| Legal compliance | Legal review for regulated topics |
| Accessibility | WCAG checklist at publish |
| Data accuracy | Fact-check in substantive edit pass |
| Content freshness | Quarterly audit with age thresholds |
| Taxonomy | Controlled vocabulary via CMS |

Audit cadence: monthly (top 20 pages), quarterly (content > 6 months), annually (full inventory).

## Measurement

| Tier | Metrics | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Reach | Pageviews, impressions, unique visitors | Is it being found? |
| Engagement | Time on page, scroll depth, bounce rate | Is it being consumed? |
| Conversion | Signups, downloads, demo requests | Is it driving action? |
| Revenue | Pipeline influenced, deals closed | Is it moving the business? |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Strategy by committee**: Too many stakeholders dilute voice and slow production
- **Persona fiction**: Building personas from assumptions, not observed behavior
- **Ignoring distribution**: Spend as much effort on promotion as creation
