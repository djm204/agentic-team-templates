# Copywriting

Principles and frameworks for persuasive writing across headlines, landing pages, emails, ads, and conversion-focused content.

## Core Principle

**Great copy is clear before it is clever.** Persuasion comes from understanding the audience's pain and presenting a credible solution.

## Persuasion Frameworks

| Framework | Structure | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| AIDA | Attention-Interest-Desire-Action | Landing pages, ads |
| PAS | Problem-Agitate-Solve | Email sequences, sales pages |
| BAB | Before-After-Bridge | Case studies, testimonials |
| 4Ps | Promise-Picture-Proof-Push | Direct response |
| FAB | Feature-Advantage-Benefit | Product descriptions |

## Headline Writing

Test every headline for: specificity, benefit clarity, curiosity, under-3-second comprehension, and length (under 70 chars SEO / under 40 social).

Proven patterns:
- `How to [Result] Without [Pain Point]`
- `[Number] Ways to [Benefit] in [Timeframe]`
- `Why [Common Belief] Is Wrong (And What to Do Instead)`
- `The [Audience]'s Guide to [Topic]`

## Email Copywriting

- Subject line under 50 chars; specific over mysterious; no ALL CAPS
- Preview text extends subject, doesn't repeat it
- Opening line: personal, relevant, or surprising
- Body: one idea, short paragraphs, one link max, bolded key phrase
- CTA: single clear action ("Read the framework" not "Click here")

## Landing Page Copy

- One page, one goal — every element supports a single conversion action
- Lead with benefit, not feature; social proof near CTA
- FAQ handles top 3-5 objections; urgency must be real
- CTA buttons: start with verb, name the value ("Get the Free Template")

## Voice and Tone

- Voice = consistent brand personality (doesn't change)
- Tone = emotional adjustment for context (changes per situation)
- Calibrate by situation: formality, emotion, pace

## Common Pitfalls

- **Feature dumping**: List features without translating to reader benefits
- **CTA overload**: Multiple competing calls to action dilute conversion
- **Fake urgency**: "Limited time!" on an offer that never expires destroys trust
