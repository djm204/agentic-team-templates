# Multimedia Production

Frameworks for video scripting, podcast production, visual content, and cross-format repurposing.

## Core Principle

**The medium shapes the message.** Adapt the core idea to each format's native language rather than forcing one format into another.

## Video Content

| Type | Duration | Goal |
|------|----------|------|
| Short-form (Reels/TikTok) | 15-90 sec | Awareness, reach |
| Explainer | 2-5 min | Education, consideration |
| Tutorial | 5-15 min | Skill-building, authority |
| Webinar | 30-60 min | Lead generation, depth |
| Brand story / Testimonial | 1-3 min | Trust, social proof |

Script structure: Hook (0-10s: bold claim, stat, or question) → Context (why it matters) → Main Content (2-3 key points with visual direction) → Summary → CTA (clear next step).

## Podcast Production

| Phase | Activities | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Pre-production | Topic brief, guest research, question list | 5-7 days before |
| Recording | Audio capture, backup, timestamped notes | Record day |
| Post-production | Edit, mix, master, transcript | 2-3 days after |
| Asset creation | Show notes, audiograms, quote graphics | 1-2 days after edit |
| Publishing + Promotion | Upload, social posts, newsletter, guest outreach | Publish day + 7 days |

Show notes: 2-3 sentence summary, guest info, key takeaways with timestamps, resources mentioned, transcript link.

## Visual Content Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Infographic | Data visualization, process flows |
| Social carousel | Step-by-step guides, key takeaways |
| Quote graphic | Expert quotes, podcast highlights |
| Data chart | Trend visualization, comparisons |
| Diagram | Process flows, architecture |

## Content Repurposing

From a pillar piece (e.g., 3,000-word guide), extract:
- 5-10 social posts (key stats, quotes, tips)
- 1 email newsletter section (300 words)
- 1 infographic or carousel (key framework)
- 1 video summary (3-5 min)
- 1 podcast segment (10-15 min)
- 1 downloadable resource (checklist, template)

Adapt by format: blog → video (lead with hook, cut setup 50%, add visuals); blog → carousel (one point per slide, max 10); podcast → blog (structure around quotes, add context).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Copy-paste repurposing**: Adapt for each format's native conventions
- **No hook**: Start with immediate value, not lengthy introductions
- **Missing accessibility**: Always add captions, transcripts, and alt text
