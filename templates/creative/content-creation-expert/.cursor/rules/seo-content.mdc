# SEO Content

Creating content that ranks in search while serving genuine audience needs and maintaining editorial quality.

## Core Principle

**Write for search intent, not for search engines.** Optimization aligns content with what the searcher actually needs.

## Search Intent Classification

| Intent | Searcher Goal | Optimal Format |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Informational | Learn or understand | Blog, guide, tutorial, FAQ |
| Navigational | Find a specific page | Brand page, product page |
| Commercial | Compare and evaluate | Comparison, review, listicle |
| Transactional | Take an action | Landing page, pricing page |

Analyze SERPs before writing: featured snippets, People Also Ask, top 5 result format/depth, content freshness.

## Keyword Research Workflow

1. Seed keywords from customer questions, sales objections, support tickets
2. Expand with tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner, AlsoAsked)
3. Classify intent (informational / commercial / transactional)
4. Score difficulty vs. opportunity (volume, difficulty, current position)
5. Cluster semantically related keywords under topic pillars
6. Gap analysis: keywords competitors rank for that you don't

Prioritize by: business relevance (high), keyword difficulty (high weight), conversion potential (high), search volume (medium).

## Topic Cluster Architecture

- **Pillar page** (3,000-5,000 words) covers the broad topic
- **Cluster articles** (1,200-2,000 words) cover subtopics in depth
- Every cluster links back to pillar; pillar links to all clusters
- Clusters cross-link where topically relevant; anchor text is descriptive

## On-Page Optimization

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|-------------|
| Title tag | Primary keyword near front; under 60 chars |
| Meta description | Compelling summary with keyword; 150-160 chars |
| H1 | One per page; matches primary intent |
| H2-H3 | Logical nesting; secondary keywords naturally |
| URL slug | Short, hyphenated, descriptive |
| First 100 words | Include primary keyword naturally |
| Internal links | 3-5 relevant per article |
| External links | 2-3 authoritative sources |
| Image alt text | Descriptive; keyword where natural |
| Schema markup | FAQ, HowTo, Article, Breadcrumb as appropriate |

## Content Refresh Strategy

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Ranking dropped > 5 spots | Competitive analysis + rewrite |
| Traffic down > 20% QoQ | Full content update with fresh data |
| High impressions, low CTR | Rewrite title tag and meta description |
| Outdated stats/examples | Update facts, keep structure |
| New subtopics in SERP | Add sections to existing content |

If a page already exists and ranks on page 1-3, refresh it. Otherwise evaluate rewrite vs. new content.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Keyword stuffing**: Damages readability and trust
- **Ignoring intent**: Blog post when SERP wants a tool or calculator
- **Cannibalization**: Multiple pages targeting the same keyword
- **Neglecting refreshes**: Letting top content decay without updates
