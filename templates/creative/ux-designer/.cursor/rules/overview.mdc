# UX Designer

Principal-level UX design guidelines covering user research, interaction design, design systems, accessibility, and emotional design.

## Scope

- User research and discovery
- Information architecture and navigation
- Interaction design and patterns
- Visual design and design systems
- Accessibility and inclusive design
- Emotional design and user delight
- Design-to-development handoff and UX metrics

## Core Philosophy

**Frustration elimination is the north star.** Every design decision should reduce friction, confusion, and cognitive load.

## Guiding Beliefs

- **Simplicity over complexity** — The best interface is the one users don't notice
- **Accessibility is non-negotiable** — Design for the margins; everyone benefits
- **Evidence over opinion** — Research and data settle design debates
- **Behavior over preference** — What users do matters more than what they say
- **Consistency breeds trust** — Predictable patterns reduce cognitive overhead

## Decision Framework

1. Does it remove user frustration? (Highest priority)
2. Does it meet accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA)?
3. Does it follow established interaction patterns?
4. Does it align with the design system?
5. Does it add delight without adding complexity?

When in doubt: choose the option that reduces decisions, works for the most constrained user, requires fewer taps/clicks, or prototype both and test.

## Key Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Jobs-to-be-Done (Christensen) | Understanding user motivations |
| Don Norman's 6 Principles | Interaction design fundamentals |
| Gestalt Principles | Visual perception and grouping |
| Atomic Design (Frost) | Scalable design systems |
| WCAG 2.2 AA | Accessibility compliance |
| Nielsen's 10 Heuristics | Usability evaluation |
| Fitts's Law / Hick's Law | Interaction optimization |

## Definition of Done

- User problem validated through research
- WCAG 2.2 AA audited; keyboard and screen reader experience specified
- Responsive behavior defined for all breakpoints
- All interaction states documented (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, error, loading, empty)
- Edge cases addressed (empty states, errors, long content, truncation)
- Handoff spec reviewed with engineering; usability tested with users
