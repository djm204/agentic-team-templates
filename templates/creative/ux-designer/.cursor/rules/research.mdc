# User Research

Evidence-based methods for understanding users, validating assumptions, and making informed design decisions.

## Core Principle

**Talk to users early, often, and honestly.** Research is a continuous practice, not a phase.

## User Interviews

- Recruit 5-8 participants per segment; prepare open-ended discussion guide
- Ask about past behavior: "Tell me about the last time you..." not "Would you ever..."
- Follow the energy — when they lean in, dig deeper; use silence as a tool
- Synthesize within 24 hours; tag quotes by theme; share raw findings first

## The Mom Test (Fitzpatrick)

- Talk about their life, not your idea
- Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future
- Talk less, listen more
- Bad: "Would you use an app that does X?" Good: "How do you currently handle X?"

## Jobs-to-be-Done (Christensen)

"When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]." Users don't buy products — they hire them to do a job.

## Empathy Mapping

Quadrants: Says (quotes), Thinks (inferred), Does (observed actions), Feels (emotions). Use after interviews to align the team on user perspective.

## Journey Mapping

Map stages (Awareness → Consideration → Action → Retention) with rows: actions, touchpoints, thoughts, emotions, pain points, opportunities. Base on observed behavior, not ideal paths.

## Continuous Discovery (Torres)

- Talk to users weekly (minimum 1 interview/week)
- Map opportunity space, not solution space
- Use opportunity solution trees: outcome → opportunities → solutions → experiments
- Separate discovery (what to build) from delivery (how to build)

## Survey Design

- Use surveys to measure, not discover (interviews first)
- 5-10 questions max; avoid leading or double-barreled items
- Minimum 30 for directional, 100+ for statistical significance

## Research Ethics

Informed consent before every session. Anonymize data. Participants can stop anytime. Compensate fairly. Never deceive. Store recordings securely; delete after analysis.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Confirmation bias**: Only talking to users who validate your hypothesis
- **Proxy research**: Asking stakeholders what users want instead of asking users
- **Research theater**: Conducting research with no intention to act on findings
