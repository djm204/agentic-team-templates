# Information Architecture

Organizing, structuring, and labeling content so users can find what they need.

## Core Principle

**If users can't find it, it doesn't exist.**

## Four Core Systems (Rosenfeld & Morville)

1. **Organization** — How content is grouped and categorized
2. **Labeling** — How content is named and described
3. **Navigation** — How users move through content
4. **Search** — How users query and filter content

## Mental Models (Indi Young)

Align structure to how users think, not how the org is structured. Interview users about tasks, map their model, identify gaps, align IA to their model.

## Miller's Law

Users hold ~4 items in working memory. Limit primary nav to 4-7 items, chunk related content, use progressive disclosure, avoid menus deeper than 3 levels.

## Card Sorting

- **Open sort**: Users create/name groups — use when building IA from scratch (15+ participants)
- **Closed sort**: Users sort into predefined categories — use to validate existing IA
- Agreement rates > 60% indicate confident groupings; low agreement means relabel or restructure

## Tree Testing

Validate findability without visual design. Text-only tree + tasks ("Where would you find X?"). Success rate > 80% = strong IA. Directness > 70% = clear paths. 50+ participants.

## Navigation Patterns

- **Top bar**: 4-7 items (web); **Sidebar**: 8+ items or deep hierarchies; **Bottom tabs**: 3-5 core actions (mobile)
- **Hamburger menu**: Last resort — hides everything, reduces discoverability
- Current location always visible; labels are nouns; icon + label > icon alone
- **Breadcrumbs**: Use when hierarchy is 3+ levels deep
- **Search**: Autocomplete after 2+ chars, fuzzy matching, recent searches, scoped to current section

## Sitemaps and User Flows

- **Sitemaps**: Hierarchical tree of all pages, user-facing names, versioned
- **User flows**: Flowcharts from user goal (not homepage), including error paths and entry points

## Labeling

- Use the user's language, not internal jargon
- Be specific ("Order History" > "History") and consistent
- Test labels with tree testing or first-click testing

## Anti-Patterns

- **Org-chart navigation**: Structuring IA to match departments
- **Deep nesting**: Content 4+ levels deep
- **Mystery meat navigation**: Icons without labels, hover-only reveals
