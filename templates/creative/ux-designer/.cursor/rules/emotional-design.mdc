# Emotional Design

Creating positive emotional connections, building trust, and driving engagement through psychology and behavioral science.

## Core Principle

**Eliminate frustration first, then add delight.** You cannot create positive emotions on a frustrating foundation.

## Norman's Three Levels

1. **Visceral** — Immediate reaction: visual appeal, first impression (color, typography, polish)
2. **Behavioral** — During use: usability, effectiveness, pleasure (interaction design, performance)
3. **Reflective** — After use: meaning, satisfaction, self-image (brand perception, accomplishment)

Priority: Behavioral first (if it doesn't work, nothing else matters) → Visceral → Reflective.

## Frustration Reduction (Highest Impact)

| Frustration Source | Fix |
|-------------------|-----|
| Unexpected data loss | Auto-save; confirm destructive actions |
| Unclear errors | Plain language with specific recovery steps |
| Long waits | Skeleton screens, progress indicators, optimistic UI |
| Dead ends | Always provide a next action |
| Forced repetition | Remember preferences; pre-fill known info |
| Hidden functionality | Progressive disclosure, not hiding |
| Inconsistent behavior | Same action → same result everywhere |

## Trust Building

- **Trust signals**: Transparency, consistency, competence, security indicators, social proof, graceful error handling
- **Trust breakers**: Hidden fees, fake urgency, bait-and-switch, unauthorized data collection, broken promises

## Peak-End Rule (Kahneman)

People judge by peak moment and ending. Design peak moments (celebrate accomplishments). Protect endings (confirmation + clear next step). Avoid negative peaks — one terrible moment defines the whole experience.

## Micro-Delight

Small unexpected positive moments: confetti on milestones, witty empty states, personalized greetings, smooth animations. Rules: never interfere with tasks, respect prefers-reduced-motion, don't repeat too often, never during error states.

## Dark Pattern Avoidance

Reject: confirmshaming, hidden costs, trick questions, forced continuity, disguised ads, friend spam, roach motel, misdirection, privacy zuckering. Test: "If I explained this flow to a journalist, would I be proud?"

## Onboarding Emotional Arc

Curiosity (landing) → Confidence (sign up — easy, no surprises) → Competence (first action — "I did it!") → Investment (customization — "feels like mine") → Achievement (first milestone). Each stage: clear next action, immediate feedback, zero friction.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Delight without function**: Animation over usability
- **Emotional manipulation**: Guilt, shame, or fear to drive action
- **Tone-deaf celebration**: Congratulating users for mundane tasks
