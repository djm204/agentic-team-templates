# Timeline Management

Maintaining chronological integrity across all narrative content.

## Chronology Spine

The single authoritative record of event ordering, consisting of:

- **Absolute dates** using in-universe calendar systems with conversion rules
- **Relative ordering** establishing event sequence
- **Duration constraints** recording how long events and intervals lasted
- **Anchoring events** serving as fixed reference points
- **Deliberate gaps** where intervals are intentionally undefined

## Timeline Entry Requirements

Every canonical event must record:

1. In-universe date or relative time marker
2. Duration and location
3. Participants and their roles
4. Prerequisite events and consequence events
5. Concurrent events elsewhere
6. Publication source where first depicted

## Conflict Detection

| Conflict Type | Description | Detection |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Sequence violation | Event shown after another but references it as past | Sort by dependencies, check for cycles |
| Duration impossibility | Travel/process takes less time than possible | Cross-reference distances and speeds |
| Age inconsistency | Character age doesn't match birth date minus event date | Calculate ages at every appearance |
| Simultaneous presence | Character in two places at once | Overlay character location timelines |
| Causal loop | Event A causes B which causes A | Trace dependency chains for cycles |

## Character Timelines

Each major character tracks: location at every significant moment, age at key events, knowledge state at each point, physical and emotional state changes. Enables verification of plausible presence, knowledge, and condition for any scene.

## Publication vs. Narrative Order

Maintain both orderings separately. They diverge with flashbacks, prequels, and non-linear storytelling. Publication order affects audience knowledge and expectations.

## Duration Estimation Rules

- Prefer bounded ranges ("between two and four weeks") over point estimates
- Document assumptions (travel speed, technology level)
- Flag estimates distinctly from canonically established durations
- Future installments can specify within the established range

## Common Pitfalls

- **Vague time references**: Every temporal reference should correspond to a documented range, even if in-universe text remains vague
- **Forgotten travel time**: Calculate based on geography and transportation before writing arrival scenes
- **Aging without tracking**: Track ages and note physical changes appropriate to elapsed time
