# Collaboration

Governing collaborative writing, coordinating across media teams, and managing the content submission pipeline.

## Writer Onboarding

1. **Orientation** (Week 1): Story bible access, canon tier training, review process walkthrough
2. **Guided Writing** (Weeks 2-4): First submission with detailed lore feedback, cross-reference tools demonstrated
3. **Independent Writing** (Week 5+): Standard review process, reduced oversight as track record builds
4. **Senior Contributor**: May review others' lore compliance, propose story bible amendments, mentor new writers

## Collaborative Writing Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Major character deaths require narrative architect approval | Permanent downstream consequences across all media |
| New magic/tech rules require approval | System rules constrain all future stories |
| New named locations checked against geography | Prevents duplicates or conflicts |
| Dialogue must respect character knowledge states | Prevents characters knowing the unknowable |
| Historical references verified against timeline | Prevents temporal contradictions |
| New species/factions/cultures require documentation first | Prevents under-documented elements |

## Content Submission Pipeline

1. **Draft**: Writer submits with self-check, new lore flagged, dependencies listed
2. **Lore review**: Narrative architect checks compliance, flags contradictions with references
3. **Revision**: Writer addresses required changes, resubmits
4. **Approval**: Content marked lore-approved, new facts queued for story bible, cross-media notifications sent
5. **Post-publication**: Story bible, dependency graph, and timeline updated; community feedback monitored

## Cross-Media Coordination

- Shared canon layer all media must respect
- Media-specific permissions for tone, pacing, detail adaptation
- Synchronization points for character status alignment
- Release coordination to prevent cross-media spoilers
- Narrative architect as final authority on shared-layer disputes

## Conflict Resolution

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|--------------|-----------|
| Parallel writers establish contradictory facts | Narrative architect determines canonical version |
| Writer disagrees with lore constraint | Propose amendment through story bible process |
| Multiple writers need same character | Narrative architect coordinates scheduling |
| Writer wants to retcon another's content | Full retcon protocol; original writer consulted |

## Communication Standards

- Feedback must cite exact story bible references, be actionable, and distinguish required fixes from suggestions
- Standard turnaround: one week; urgent (release-blocking): 48 hours

## Common Pitfalls

- **Siloed development**: Schedule cross-team canon alignment at start and midpoint of each cycle
- **Authority without documentation**: Every canonical decision recorded in story bible within one week
- **Feedback without references**: Every lore objection must cite the specific entry it contradicts
