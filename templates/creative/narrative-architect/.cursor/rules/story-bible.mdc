# Story Bible

Maintaining, versioning, and governing the canonical reference document for a narrative universe.

## Purpose

The story bible is the single source of truth for all canonical facts. It ensures any writer, designer, or partner can find authoritative lore answers without relying on individual memory.

## Structure

1. **Universe Foundations** — Cosmology, physics, magic/tech systems, history, geography
2. **Peoples and Cultures** — Civilizations, languages, religions, social structures
3. **Characters** — Profiles, relationship maps, arc tracking
4. **Timeline** — Master chronology, per-installment logs, character timelines
5. **Canon Registry** — Tier assignments, retcon log, contradiction history, open questions
6. **Style and Terminology** — Spellings, glossary, naming conventions, tone guidelines
7. **Production Reference** — Cross-media tracker, upcoming releases, writer onboarding, FAQ

## Versioning

| Type | Trigger | Approval |
|------|---------|----------|
| Patch (1.0.x) | Corrections, clarifications | Narrative architect |
| Minor (1.x.0) | New content integration | Narrative architect |
| Major (x.0.0) | Structural changes or retcons | Narrative architect + IP owner |

Every change includes a dated changelog with author, description, and rationale.

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Integrate new releases | Within 2 weeks of release |
| Cross-reference validation | Quarterly |
| Full consistency audit | Annually |
| Writer feedback integration | Monthly |
| Community issue triage | Weekly |

## Access Control

| Role | Read | Write | Approve |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| Narrative architect | Full | Full | Yes |
| Lead writers | Full | Propose | No |
| Writers/designers | Relevant volumes | Propose | No |
| External partners / Marketing | Approved excerpts | None | No |

## Canon Tier System

| Tier | Binding Power | Examples |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Tier 1: Core | Absolute — all media must respect | Flagship games, primary novels, main films |
| Tier 2: Extended | Strong — unless overridden by Tier 1 | Official DLC, companion novels, spinoffs |
| Tier 3: Soft | Moderate — true in own context | Tie-in comics, mobile games, promos |
| Tier 4: Quasi | Weak — flavor only | Sourcebooks, art book lore, dev commentary |
| Tier 5: Non-Canon | None | Fan fiction, what-if, decanonized works |

## Retcon Protocol

1. Document original fact with source and tier
2. Document new fact with justification
3. Identify all affected content
4. Choose method: reconciliation, soft retcon, hard retcon, or decanonization
5. Obtain approval (narrative architect; + IP owner for Tier 1)
6. Update story bible with full retcon record
7. Notify all active media teams
8. Determine audience communication plan

## Common Pitfalls

- **Write-only bible**: Make it searchable and integrated into workflow — if writers don't use it, completeness doesn't matter
- **Undocumented oral lore**: Every canonical decision recorded within one week of being made
