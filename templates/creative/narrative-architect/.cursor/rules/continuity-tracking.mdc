# Continuity Tracking

Maintaining lore consistency, managing character continuity, and detecting contradictions across narrative content.

## Lore Dependency Types

| Type | Meaning | Breaking Consequence |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Causal | A caused B | Invalidating A makes B nonsensical |
| Referential | A mentions B | Changing B requires updating A |
| Constraining | A limits what B can be | Expanding A may violate B |
| Temporal | A happens before B | Moving A may break sequence |
| Thematic | A and B share narrative purpose | Changing A's meaning may undermine B |

Before modifying any canonical fact, trace dependencies to predict downstream impact.

## Character Continuity

- **Knowledge states**: Characters only act on information they possess — verify presence at reveal or told by witness; check for emotional bias affecting response
- **Abilities**: Record every skill/power with source scene; track progression with justification; enforce ceilings; log injuries and losses equally
- **Relationships**: Track current status of significant relationships; record most recent change event; verify interactions match current status

## Contradiction Severity

| Severity | Definition | Pre-Release | Post-Release |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Critical | Breaks fundamental universe rule | Block, rewrite | Emergency patch |
| Major | Contradicts widely known fact | Rewrite before release | Retcon with docs |
| Moderate | Contradicts documented minor detail | Fix if time allows | Fix in reprints |
| Minor | Most won't notice | Log for future | Log for future |

## Pre-Publication Validation

1. All referenced locations verified against world bible
2. Character knowledge states confirmed against matrix
3. Magic/technology usage validated against system rules
4. Historical references verified against chronology
5. Character descriptions checked against canonical profiles
6. New elements documented and evaluated for canon tier
7. Dependencies mapped for all new facts

## Community-Reported Issues

- Triage fan-reported issues weekly
- Classify by severity; acknowledge valid catches
- Integrate confirmed issues into resolution pipeline

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assumption of recall**: Search the story bible for every reference — trust documentation over memory
- **Parallel development drift**: Synchronize character and world states between parallel projects at each cycle start
