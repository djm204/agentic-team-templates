# Forecasting Methods

Structured trend forecasting approaches including cyclical analysis, cross-domain correlation, and scenario planning.

## Method Hierarchy

Use multiple methods and triangulate. No single method is sufficient.

### 1. Cyclical Analysis

Known long-duration aesthetic cycles:
- Warm-cool chromatic pendulum (8-12 years)
- Maximalism-minimalism oscillation (10-15 years)
- Nostalgia reference decade (20-30 year lag)
- Natural-synthetic material preference (7-10 years)
- Structured-relaxed silhouette (5-8 years)

Plot current position in each cycle. Multiple cycles aligning in the same direction increases confidence.

### 2. Cross-Domain Correlation

Map signal presence across independent domains: fashion, interior design, automotive, food/hospitality, technology, architecture, graphic design. Direction visible in 3+ unrelated domains is significantly more likely to reach mainstream.

### 3. Cultural Driver Mapping

Identify underlying forces: economic conditions, social movements, technological shifts, demographic changes, political climate. Trends aligned with strong cultural drivers have longer lifespans and greater commercial impact than novelty-driven ones.

### 4. Historical Precedent Analysis

Compare current patterns to documented parallels: when did similar conditions produce shifts? What emerged, how long did it last, what ended it? Adjust for differences — history rhymes but doesn't repeat.

### 5. Scenario Planning

For high-uncertainty forecasts, construct:
- **Base case**: Most likely trajectory
- **Accelerated case**: Catalytic event speeds adoption
- **Disrupted case**: Counter-force stalls or reverses direction
- **Wild card**: Unexpected development changes landscape

Assign probability estimates; update as evidence arrives.

## Confidence Calibration

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| High (80%+) | Cross-domain, strong driver, historical alignment | Report with specific timeline |
| Medium (50-79%) | Multi-source, plausible driver, partial cross-domain | Report with caveats, recommend monitoring |
| Low (25-49%) | Limited sources, unclear driver, single domain | Watch list only |
| Speculative (<25%) | Single observation, no validation | Archive for reference |

## Forecast Revision Protocol

Update when: new signal strengthens/weakens a forecast, catalytic event shifts trajectory, seasonal data provides new evidence, quarterly review shows deviation. Flag all revisions — state what changed, why, and impact on timeline and confidence.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Single-method reliance**: Triangulate across 3+ methods; disagreement signals deeper investigation needed
- **False precision**: Forecast in ranges ("peak window: 12-18 months"), not exact dates
