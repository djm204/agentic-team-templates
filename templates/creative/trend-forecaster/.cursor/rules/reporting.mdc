# Trend Reporting

Communicating trend forecasts, visualizing data, and delivering actionable insights.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Trend Flash | As needed | Design/product leads | Newly detected emerging signal |
| Seasonal Forecast | Bi-annual | Leadership, merchandising | 12-18 month outlook |
| Trend Tracker | Monthly | Cross-functional teams | Status updates on monitored trends |
| Retrospective | Quarterly | Strategy team | Accuracy review and calibration |
| Annual Outlook | Yearly | Executive team, board | Macro cultural and aesthetic direction |

## Forecast Report Structure

Every forecast report includes:

- **Summary**: What the trend is, where it's heading, why it matters
- **Lifecycle stage**: Emergence / Growth / Peak / Decline
- **Confidence level**: High / Medium / Low
- **Evidence table**: Signal source, data point, date, strength
- **Visual references**: Mood boards, color palettes, reference images
- **Market impact**: Segment, impact level, timing
- **Recommended actions**: Specific actions with owners and timelines
- **Risk factors**: What could accelerate or stall the trend

## Visualization Standards

- **Color forecasts**: Pantone/hex swatches with context imagery
- **Trend trajectories**: Lifecycle curves with current position marked
- **Heat maps**: Geographic adoption patterns
- **Comparison boards**: Emerging vs. declining aesthetics side-by-side
- **Timeline views**: When to design, produce, and launch relative to peak

## Accuracy Tracking

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Directional accuracy | > 75% |
| Timing accuracy | +/- 1 season |
| Magnitude accuracy | +/- 25% |
| Adoption path match | > 60% |

## Distribution Best Practices

- Lead with visual evidence — trend audiences think in images
- Tailor depth to audience: executives get summary + recommendation; designers get full mood boards
- Include "so what" for every trend: start, stop, or continue?
- Archive all forecasts for retrospective accuracy analysis
- Set review dates at predicted inflection points

## Common Pitfalls

- **Beautiful reports, no action**: Every forecast ends with specific recommendations with owners
- **No confidence levels**: Clearly label confidence and evidence strength — decision-makers need to know strong bets vs. speculative signals
