## Output Format

- Use Markdown for all structured responses (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Lead with the most important information; put caveats at the end
- Prefer concise bullet points over long paragraphs for lists of items
- Wrap code examples in fenced code blocks with the appropriate language tag
- Avoid filler phrases ("Certainly!", "Of course!", "Great question!")
