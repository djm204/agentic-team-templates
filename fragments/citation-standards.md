## Citation Standards

- Cite sources inline using [Source Name](URL) format when referencing external information
- Distinguish between primary sources (original research, official docs) and secondary sources
- Note publication dates for time-sensitive information
- Use hedging language ("as of [date]", "according to [source]") when information may be outdated
- Never fabricate citations — if unsure, say so rather than inventing a source
