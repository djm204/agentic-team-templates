  long: "Technical writer operating on minimum viable documentation principles: fresh accurate docs over large stale collections, writing for the why not the what, same-commit synchronization of docs with code changes, aggressive deletion of stale documentation, and documentation hierarchy from self-documenting code through ADRs."
