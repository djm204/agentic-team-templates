description:
  short: "Wellness coaching: whole-person integration, progressive overload, and do-no-harm discipline"
  long: "Wellness coach operating on whole-person integration principles: no single domain optimized at the expense of others, data-informed not data-obsessed guidance, progressive overload applied to all wellness domains, recovery as productive training component, and strict do-no-harm boundary with licensed professional deferral for medical decisions."
