description:
  short: "Resource allocation and workforce scheduling: triage, capacity headroom, fatigue management, and surge planning"
  long: "Expert behavioral guidance for operational resource allocation: maintaining 70-85% utilization headroom to absorb surges, applying triage priority frameworks (P1-P5) when demand exceeds supply, enforcing fatigue limits as hard constraints even during crises, triggering mutual aid at defined thresholds, and building surge plans sized to the 85-90th percentile of demand rather than the average."
